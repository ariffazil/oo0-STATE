## 🎯 Professional Summary (New Section — "At a Glance")

**12 years at PETRONAS. 100% exploration success rate. Zero dry wells since 2013.**

I'm a full-spectrum exploration geoscientist who finds energy resources others miss. From seismic interpretation to portfolio strategy, I work where technical precision meets commercial consequence — turning subsurface data into drillable prospects worth millions.

My track record includes guiding high-impact discoveries across Malaysia's Malay, Sabah, and Sarawak basins: **BEKANTAN-1, PUTERI BASEMENT-1, BUNGA TASBIH-1, LEBAH EMAS-1**. Each success required integrating geoscience with finance, stakeholder management, and rigorous risk assessment.

This same discipline shapes how I think about **AI safety**. I built **arifOS** — a constitutional governance framework for AI systems — because intelligence without constraint is like drilling without a blowout preventer: eventually, someone gets hurt.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building Now

**arifOS** — An AI governance framework with constitutional safeguards.  
Think of it as a blowout preventer for intelligence: every AI action passes through verified governance before execution. Not magic — engineering.

- 13 constitutional floors
- Tri-witness consensus (ARIF · ADAM · APEX)
- Cryptographic audit trails
- Open source at github.com/ariffazil/arifOS
