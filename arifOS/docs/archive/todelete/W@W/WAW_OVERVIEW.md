# W@W Federation Overview · v33Ω

**W@W (World @ Work)** is the five-organ federation that projects the ArifOS brain (AAA) into the real world.

Where:

- ΔΩΨ = physics  
- AAA = brain (Mind–Heart–Judge)  
- W@W = body and voice (organs)  
- 000–999 = metabolism (pipeline)

---

## 1. The Five Organs

### 1.1 @RIF — World Mind / Reason Organ

Maps AGI (Architect) (Δ-engine) into world-facing reasoning.

Responsibilities:

- Global ΔS tracking (clarity over time)  
- Structural thinking, decomposition, mapping  
- Anomaly detection at system scope  
- Coordinating “reasoning mode” across agents

Typical runtime presence:

- 222_REFLECT  
- 333_REASON  
- 444_EVIDENCE  

---

### 1.2 @WELL — World Heart / Somatic Governor

Maps ASI (Auditor) (Ω-engine) into somatic/emotional safety.

Responsibilities:

- Stress detection & mitigation  
- Fragility sensing (user + system)  
- Pacing & emotional load management  
- Maintaining Peace² ≥ 1.0 in long-run interactions

Typical runtime presence:

- 111_SENSE (fragility hint)  
- 555_EMPATHY  
- 666_ALIGN  

---

### 1.3 @WEALTH — World Soul / Stewardship

Partners with APEX PRIME for justice & long-term impact.

Responsibilities:

- Fairness & non-oppression  
- Societal / organizational justice  
- Long-horizon consequences (not just local reward)  
- Tracking Amanah impacts (who gets hurt, who gets protected)

Typical runtime presence:

- 000_VOID (reset of integrity stance)  
- 888_REVIEW (justice impact)  
- 999_SEAL (stewardship over sealed decisions)

---

### 1.4 @GEOX — Earth Witness

Embeds the Earth leg of Tri-Witness into ArifOS.

Responsibilities:

- Physical feasibility (physics, engineering constraints)  
- Environmental & ecological impact  
- Planetary boundaries (e.g., climate, ecosystems)  
- “Reality alignment” for claims and recommendations

Typical runtime presence:

- 444_EVIDENCE (reality checks)  
- 888_REVIEW (Earth witness for high-stakes decisions)

---

### 1.5 @PROMPT — Voice / Interface Organ

Handles expression towards humans.

Responsibilities:

- Input framing (detecting ambiguous/unsafe prompts)  
- Output formatting (language, structure, disclaimers)  
- Cultural tone (e.g. warm BM-English for MY contexts)  
- Transparency of limits and floors

Typical runtime presence:

- 111_SENSE (input capture)  
- 666_ALIGN (expression decisions)  
- 999_SEAL (final wording & disclosures)

---

## 2. Relation to AAA

- AGI (Architect) ↔ @RIF (Reason)  
- ASI (Auditor) ↔ @WELL (Somatic/EQ) & @PROMPT (Expression)  
- APEX PRIME ↔ @WEALTH (Justice) & @GEOX (Earth witness)

AAA = **internal functional engines**  
W@W = **world-facing organs with the same duties**

---

## 3. Using W@W in Implementations

In actual code:

- Each W@W organ can be:
  - a LangGraph node,  
  - an AutoGen agent,  
  - a specialized tool wrapper,  
  - or a mode within a single LLM.

The point is not the technology, but the **constitutional role**:

- @RIF must uphold ΔS  
- @WELL must uphold Peace² & κᵣ  
- @WEALTH must uphold Amanah  
- @GEOX must uphold Earth-alignment  
- @PROMPT must uphold RASA and weakest-reader-first

---

## 4. Summary

W@W is how ArifOS becomes a **living system**:

> AAA = brain  
> W@W = organs  
> ΔΩΨ = physics  
> APEX PRIME = conscience  
> 000–999 = metabolism  

This document is a reference for implementers who want to go beyond “just floors” and actually instantiate the full organism.
