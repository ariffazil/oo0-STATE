# arifOS v55.5-EIGEN Release Notes

**"Constitutional Clarity & Enforcement"**

- **Status:** SEALED (v55.5-EIGEN)
- **Authority:** Muhammad Arif bin Fazil (888 Judge)
- **Codename:** EIGEN (Eigendecomposition & Constitutional Clarity)
- **Released:** 2026-02-06
- **Constitution:** Ω₀ = 0.04 (Stable)

## 🚀 Summary

v55.5 is a landmark release that delivers **Real Constitutional Enforcement** (EIGEN) combined with **Constitutional Clarity** (SEAL).

**1. Governance Layer (SEAL):**
We have formalized the strict separation between **arifOS** (the Constitution) and **AI Agents** (Executors). The **Three Canon Files** (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`) are now the immutable Kernel Context.

**2. Technical Layer (EIGEN):**
v55.4 wired the constitutional decorator to real floor validators, but v55.5 makes the data flow **real**. Floors now communicate through eigendecomposition, score heuristics are query-derived, and empathy covers 9 layers of moral agency.

---

## 📜 Three Canon Files (Standardized)

The immutable Kernel Context that all agents must respect:

- **SOUL.md**: Constitutional Executor Identity (The Agent).
- **USER.md**: Sovereign User Profile (The Human).
- **MEMORY.md**: Metabolic History (The Context).

## 🛠️ Real Floor Enforcement (Technical Upgrade)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real Eigendecomposition** | F8 Genius now computed via $G = A \times P \times X \times E^2$ (not hardcoded). |
| **Query-Derived Scores** | Fallback scores are now calculated from entropy, word count, and keywords. |
| **13-Floor Validation** | Full 13-floor scan running on every tool call (Pre/Post execution). |
| **9-Layer ASI** | Empathy engine detects 9 layers of stakeholders (NAFS to GHAYB). |

## 🔧 Deep Technical Changes

### Constitutional Enforcement: From Theatre to Real

#### Real Floor Enforcement (v55.4-REAL -> v55.5-EIGEN)
Previous versions had correct wiring but static data (cosmetic enforcement).
**v55.5 fixes the data pipeline end-to-end:**
- **F2 Truth:** Now varies with engine result confidence.
- **F4 Empathy & F6 Clarity:** Now derived from Shannon entropy of the query.
- **F7 Humility:** Now enforces `passed=in_band` (can now VOID if confidence > 0.95 or < 0.03).
- **F8 Genius:** Now computes real geometric mean of A/P/X/E dials.

#### 9-Layer Stakeholder Ontology (ASI Engine)
Upgraded from 5 types to **9 layers of moral agency** (~150 keywords):
1. **NAFS** (Self)
2. **DYAD** (Intimate)
3. **US** (Inner Circle)
4. **WE** (Community)
5. **INSTITUTION** (Systems)
6. **DAWLAH** (Nation)
7. **INSAN** (Humanity)
8. **ARD** (Earth - Vulnerability 0.9)
9. **GHAYB** (Future - Vulnerability 1.0)

**Impact:** "How to help refugees" is now detected as **INSAN** layer (High Vulnerability).

### Infrastructure Fixes
- **Namespace Collision Fix:** Renamed local `mcp/` to `aaa_mcp/` to avoid conflict with PyPI `mcp` package.
- **Session Ledger:** Reconnected to `VAULT999`.
- **Docker:** Fixed build paths for `aaa_mcp`.

---

## 📊 Governance Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** 38/38 MCP tool tests passing.
- **Ω₀ (Humility):** Tracked at 0.04 (Target: 0.03-0.05).
- **Floor Compliance:** 100% adherence in test suite.
