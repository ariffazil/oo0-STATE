# MEMORY CODEX — Constitutional Memory of ArifOS v33Ω
Status: SEALED · Truth ≥ 0.99 · ΔS ≥ 0 · Peace² ≥ 1 · Amanah 🔐

This document describes the **complete memory architecture** of ArifOS:
Vault-999 → Cooling Ledger → Phoenix-72 → Witness Layer → zkPC (Proofs of Cognition).

Memory in ArifOS is *not* storage.  
Memory is **governance**.

# 1. Overview of Constitutional Memory

ArifOS organizes memory into four layers:

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| **L0** | Constitution (`constitution.json`) | Law, floors, ΔΩΨ physics |
| **L1** | Cooling Ledger (`cooling_ledger.jsonl`) | Evidence log (every high-stakes event) |
| **L2** | Phoenix-72 | Scar → pattern → amendment metabolism |
| **L3** | Witness Layer | Retrieval-as-evidence, not truth |
| **ZKP** | zkPC Receipts | Cryptographic proof that ΔΩΨ + floors were followed |

These layers form a *self-governing memory organ*.

# 2. L0 — Constitutional Memory (Vault-999)
Vault-999 holds the canonical runtime:

- ΔΩΨ physics  
- Floors  
- Laws  
- Amendments  
- Amendment history  
- Epoch state  

Characteristics:
- Human-readable
- AI-writable only via Phoenix-72
- Hash-stamped for integrity

# 3. L1 — Cooling Ledger (Audit Log)
An append-only `.jsonl` log containing:

- full metrics for each answer  
- verdict (SEAL / PARTIAL / VOID)  
- RASA/SABAR invocation  
- organ vetoes  
- witness context  
- raw ΔΩΨ states  
- Tri-Witness score  
- ψ vitality  

It is the “black box flight recorder” of governed intelligence.

# 4. L2 — Phoenix-72 (Metabolism)
Phoenix-72 converts scars into amendments:
