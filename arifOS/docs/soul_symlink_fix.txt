# Simple Symlink Fix for APEX
# This is the EASIEST possible fix - just create a pointer file

## Option 1: Create a symlink file directly

In your arif-fazil-sites repo, create a file named exactly: `soul`

Contents of the file (just one line):
```
THEORY
```

That's it. Commit and push. Cloudflare will follow the pointer.

## Option 2: Create via GitHub web interface

1. Go to: https://github.com/ariffazil/arif-fazil-sites
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name: `soul`
4. Content: `THEORY`
5. Click "Commit new file"

This creates a symlink that points Cloudflare to the right folder.

---

## Why this works

Cloudflare is looking for: `/opt/buildhome/repo/soul`
Your code is in: `/opt/buildhome/repo/THEORY`

The `soul` file tells Cloudflare: "Go to THEORY instead"

Simple. No terminal. No dashboard. One file.
