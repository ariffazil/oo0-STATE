# DECISION_2025-11-16_BASECAMP · ArifOS v33Ω

This document records the Basecamp Lock decision for ArifOS v33Ω.

- Date: 2025-11-16
- Steward: Muhammad Arif bin Fazil
- State: v33Ω — Deployment Era

## 1. Decision

The ArifOS v33Ω runtime specification (ΔΩΨ physics, AGI·ASI·APEX Trinity, W@W organs, floors, 000–999 pipeline, SABAR, Tri-Witness) is:

- Considered conceptually complete for this epoch
- Frozen as a **constitutional baseline**
- Only changeable via versioned upgrades (e.g. v34Δ) with public change logs

## 2. Scope of the Lock

Frozen components:

- ΔΩΨ laws and thresholds
- AAA roles (ARIF, ADAM, APEX PRIME)
- W@W organ set and roles
- Eight constitutional floors
- 000–999 pipeline semantics
- SABAR protocol semantics
- Tri-Witness semantics

Evolvable components:

- Reference code (`arifos_core/`)
- Examples (`examples/`)
- Diagrams and documentation wording (non-semantic)
- Cooling Ledger schema (non-breaking extensions)

## 3. Purpose

The Basecamp Lock ensures:

- Stability for external collaborators and auditors
- A clear baseline for future comparison (v33Ω vs later epochs)
- Protection against silent drift in governance rules

Future amendments must be proposed via governance issues and recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
