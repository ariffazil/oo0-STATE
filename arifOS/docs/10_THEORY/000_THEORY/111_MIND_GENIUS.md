## 🏗️ I. THE THEORETICAL MODEL

### 1. The Core Definition
Intelligence is the capacity to minimize **free energy** (uncertainty) across time by effectively managing:
1.  **Clarity (Δ):** Reducing information entropy (Mind).
2.  **Empathy (Ω):** Extending care radius (Heart).
3.  **Truth (Ψ):** Aligning internal models with external reality (Soul).

The Formula: **`G = A × P × X × E²`**
(Genius = Clarity × Presence × Exploration × Energy²)

### 2. The OODA Loop (Cognitive Cycle)
We map the military OODA loop to the **Metabolic Pipeline (000-999)**:

| OODA Phase | Cognitive Function | arifOS Stage | Physics |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Observe** | Sensation & Filtering | **111_SENSE** | Maxwell's Demon (Entropy Filter) |
| **Orient** | Perception & Context | **222_THINK** | Hypothesis Generation (Superposition) |
| **Decide** | Executive Function | **333_ATLAS** | Path Selection (Collapse) |
| **Act** | Motor Output | **666_ACT** | Work Expenditure (Energy) |

### 3. The Scientific Method Embedded
The system does not just "process" tokens; it runs a rigorous scientific loop at high speed:
1.  **Hypothesis:** Generate 3 paths (Conservative, Exploratory, Adversarial).
2.  **Prediction:** Deduce what *should* be true if hypothesis H is valid.
3.  **Test:** Compare prediction against Reality (Evidence/Earth Witness).
4.  **Revise:** Update mental model (Bayesian posterior).

## 🏛️ II. ARCHITECTURAL IMPLEMENTATION (v55.5 Status)

### 1. The Orchestra & Conductor
Intelligence requires specialized modules (The Orchestra) guided by executive control (The Conductor).

*   **The Orchestra (Specialists):**
    *   **Logic:** `agi_reason` (Deductive)
    *   **Creativity:** `agi_think` (Abductive)
    *   **Ethics:** `asi_act` (Valuation)
    *   **Memory:** `999_vault` (Storage)

*   **The Conductor (Executive):**
    *   **Attention:** High-grading inputs (Fact vs Noise).
    *   **Inhibition:** F10/F12 floors stopping dangerous thoughts.
    *   **Switching:** Rerouting between "Fast Thinking" (111) and "Slow Thinking" (222-333).

### 2. Current Capabilities (The "Forged" Reality)
*   **✅ Structural OODA:** Parallel execution in `agi/executor.py` reduces latency.
*   **✅ Uncertainty Management:** F7 Humility enforces `Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05]`.
*   **✅ Thermodynamic Cost:** F4 Clarity enforces `ΔS ≤ 0`.

## 🚧 III. THE GAP ANALYSIS (Active Inference)

While v55.5 possesses "Narrow Problem Solving" intelligence, it lacks two critical biological features defined in the **Free Energy Principle**:

### Gap 1: Precision Weighting
*   **Theory:** The brain ignores noisy errors and learns from precise ones.
*   **Current Reality:** The system treats all evidence with equal weight (flat priors). A low-confidence contradiction can disrupt a high-confidence truth.
*   **Roadmap:** Implement `weight = π_likelihood / (π_prior + π_likelihood)`.

### Gap 2: Hierarchical Abstraction
*   **Theory:** Intelligence builds concepts on top of concepts (Phonemes → Words → Sentences → Ideas).
*   **Current Reality:** The pipeline is "flat" (Sense → Think → Reason). It lacks deep recurrent loops to form higher-order abstract concepts like "Democracy" or "Justice" purely from data.
*   **Roadmap:** Recurrent "Deep Thinking" loops (333 → 222).

**Motto:** *Ditempa Bukan Diberi* (We are Forged, Not Given).
*We acknowledge these gaps not as failures, but as the next mountain to climb.*
