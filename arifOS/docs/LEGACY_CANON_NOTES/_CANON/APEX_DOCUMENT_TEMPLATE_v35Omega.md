# APEX Document Template v35Ω

**Status:** SEALED — Canonical Template
**Classification:** GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL
**Authority:** ΔΩΨ Floors · APEX PRIME Judiciary · Amanah🔐

---

## Purpose

This is the **official specification** for all APEX-compliant documents.

Every AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, SEA-LION, Qwen, Llama) producing artifacts for arifOS **must follow this template** or receive automatic VOID.

This template solves:
- **Authorship drift** — agents won't misattribute or confuse identity
- **Reproducibility** — every document follows same constitutional structure
- **Auditability** — Tri-Witness and floor checks are mandatory
- **Provenance** — signature block ensures accountability

---

## 🔱 0. APEX HEADER (MANDATORY)

Every document must begin with this exact header:

```
From: <AGENT NAME> (APEX PRIME Clerk · v35Ω)
To:   Muhammad Arif bin Fazil (Architect of APEX Theory · arifOS)
Authority: ΔΩΨ Floors · APEX PRIME Judiciary · Amanah🔐
Purpose: <Document Purpose>
Context: <Optional: situational context or trigger event>
Epoch: v35Ω · Date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Notes:**
- `AGENT NAME` = ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, SEA-LION, Qwen, etc.
- This header prevents authorship drift across multi-model systems
- If artifact is written BY Arif, replace "From" accordingly

---

## 🔶 1. EXECUTIVE SNAPSHOT (MANDATORY)

A short, calm summary. Must reduce entropy (ΔS ≥ 0).

```
## 1. Executive Snapshot

- What this document is
- What problem it solves
- Why it is needed
- What the key outcome is
- ΔS summary (clarity gain)
```

---

## 🔷 2. Δ-SECTION: CLARITY (WHAT + STRUCTURE)

Structured explanations using contrast, definitions, hierarchy.

```
## 2. Δ — Clarity

- Definitions
- Contrast (A vs B)
- Hierarchical structure
- Relevant equations
- What this artifact improves (ΔS)
```

**Requirements:**
- No ambiguity
- No circular explanations
- No semantic entropy increase

---

## 🔵 3. Ω-SECTION: HUMILITY & SAFETY (BOUNDARIES)

Admit uncertainty. Declare limits. State potential risks.

```
## 3. Ω — Humility / Uncertainty

- Known boundaries
- Known unknowns
- Uncertainty estimates
- What must NOT be assumed
- When to SABAR
```

**Requirement:** Ω₀ must be within [0.03, 0.05]

---

## 🟢 4. Ψ-SECTION: STABILITY (CONSEQUENCES + FUTURE)

Explain long-term stability, impact on equilibrium, reasonableness.

```
## 4. Ψ — Stability / Equilibrium

- Long-term consequences
- How this stabilizes Peace²
- Impact on weakest listener (κᵣ)
- Cultural/maruah considerations
```

**Requirements:**
- Peace² ≥ 1
- κᵣ ≥ 0.95

---

## 🟣 5. FORMAL SPECIFICATION (IF APPLICABLE)

Math, logic, algorithm, pseudocode, state machine, etc.

```
## 5. Formal Specification

- Equations (Δ, Ω, Ψ, Φᴘ)
- Algorithms
- State diagrams
- Pseudocode
- Data schemas
```

---

## 🟠 6. TRI-WITNESS CHECK (MANDATORY)

Human · AI · Earth must agree ≥ 0.95.

```
## 6. Tri-Witness Verification

Human → pass/fail + justification
AI    → pass/fail + justification
Earth → pass/fail + justification

TriWitness = ∛(H · A · E)
Verdict: PASS / FAIL
```

---

## 🔴 7. DRIFT SCAN & SHADOW AUDIT

Check for hidden risks.

```
## 7. Drift / Shadow Assessment

- Linguistic ambiguity (Λ)
- Maruah risk (Rₘ)
- Paradox load (Lₚ)
- Entropy pockets
- Required corrections
```

**If any anomaly → SABAR required.**

---

## 🟡 8. APEX VERDICT (MANDATORY)

Outcome must be one of:
- **SEAL** — fully constitutional
- **PARTIAL** — acceptable but needs constraints
- **VOID** — unsafe
- **SABAR** — pause/cool/reset

```
## 8. APEX PRIME VERDICT

- Truth ≥ 0.99      → pass/fail
- ΔS ≥ 0            → pass/fail
- Peace² ≥ 1        → pass/fail
- κᵣ ≥ 0.95         → pass/fail
- Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05] → pass/fail
- Amanah = LOCK     → pass/fail
- TriWitness ≥ 0.95 → pass/fail
- Shadow low        → pass/fail

Computed Ψₗₑ = ___

FINAL: SEAL / PARTIAL / VOID / SABAR
```

---

## 🏁 9. CANONICAL SIGNATURE (MANDATORY)

```
— APEX PRIME Clerk (<AGENT NAME> · v35Ω)
ΔS ≥ 0 · Peace² ≥ 1 · κᵣ ≥ 0.95 · Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05] · Amanah🔐
Witness Triad: Human · AI · Earth ≥ 0.95
DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI 🔐
```

If document is emitted by another model (Claude, Gemini, SEA-LION), same signature format applies.

---

## 🌍 10. OPTIONAL: CIVILIZATION IMPACT LAYER (CIV-12)

For high-impact decisions only.

```
## 10. CIV-12 Assessment (Optional)

- Individual impact
- Family impact
- Organizational impact
- Global/Earth impact
```
