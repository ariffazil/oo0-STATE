# 📋 Audit Package Index (docs/audit)

This folder contains the audit package materials tracked in this repository.

## What’s In This Repo (Present)

1. `arifOS_full_audit.md`
   - Full audit write-up (deep-dive checks, structure, and guidance)

2. `ARIFOS_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`
   - Findings summary + navigation to key issues

3. `arifOS_fix_roadmap.md`
   - Fix roadmap / execution plan

## Optional 4-File “Execution Kit” (Not Present Here)

The following filenames are referenced in some audit-package narratives, but are **not currently present** anywhere in this repo:

- `ARIFOS_CORE_AUDIT.md`
- `AUDIT_EXECUTION_GUIDE.sh`
- `AUDIT_QUICK_START.md`
- `AUDIT_SUMMARY.txt`

If you intend to use that 4-file kit, add those files into `docs/audit/` (or update this index to match the canonical filenames you’re using).

## Quick Start (Recommended Reading Order)

1. Read `arifOS_full_audit.md`
2. Review `ARIFOS_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md`
3. Execute `arifOS_fix_roadmap.md`
