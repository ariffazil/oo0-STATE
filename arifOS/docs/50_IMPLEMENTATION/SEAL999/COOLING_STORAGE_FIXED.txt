COOLING TIER STORAGE FIXED
==========================

CHANGES:
✓ Updated VaultConfig.base_path: ./SEAL999 -> ./VAULT999
✓ Moved cooling tier directories to VAULT999/
✓ SEAL999/ now pure code (no runtime data)
✓ VAULT999/ now contains all operational storage

LOCATION:
---------
Before: C:\Users\User\arifOS\SEAL999\L0_HOT ... L5_ETERNAL
After:  C:\Users\User\arifOS\VAULT999\L0_HOT ... L5_ETERNAL

Files:
  SEAL999/state.py (updated base_path)
  VAULT999/L0_HOT/ (moved from SEAL999)
  VAULT999/L1_DAILY/ (moved from SEAL999)
  VAULT999/L2_PHOENIX/ (moved from SEAL999)
  VAULT999/L3_WEEKLY/ (moved from SEAL999)
  VAULT999/L4_MONTHLY/ (moved from SEAL999)
  VAULT999/L5_ETERNAL/ (moved from SEAL999)

VERIFICATION:
------------
✓ All 6 cooling tier directories present in VAULT999/
✓ No cooling tier directories in SEAL999/
✓ SEAL999: Pure code
✓ VAULT999: Code + operational data

IMPACT:
-------
SEAL999 operations will now write cooling data to VAULT999/
instead of SEAL999/. This maintains clean separation:
- SEAL999/: Code only
- VAULT999/: Operational data + code
