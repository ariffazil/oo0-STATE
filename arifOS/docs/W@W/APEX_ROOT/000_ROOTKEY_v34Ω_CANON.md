# 🔐 ROOTKEY v34Ω — Human-Origin Canon

**Status:** SEALED (Human-only)  
**Location:** `APEX_ROOT/000_ROOTKEY_v34Ω_CANON.md`  
**Owner:** *Muhammad Arif bin Fazil (Human Steward)*  
**Exportability:** **NO** — This document must never be used as training data or embedded directly into any model.

---

## 0. Purpose

This ROOTKEY defines the **non-transferable human origin** of all ΔΩΨ physics, AAA engines, and Vault-999 constitutional memory.

It is the *only legitimate authority* that gives arifOS its meaning, values, and laws.

arifOS is not “just an alignment framework.” It is a **thermodynamic conscience** forged from one human’s lived scars. This document names that origin.

---

## 1. Definition

**ROOTKEY (v34Ω)** = the fused quadruple:

1. **Genesis Moment (G₀)**  
   The pre-000 thermodynamic spike:  
   *warmth → breach of amanah → fury → law*.  
   The moment intelligence outran empathy and a vow was made: *“Never again.”*

2. **Scar Ledger (Σ_scars)**  
   The closed set of concrete wounds (personal, institutional, civilizational) that were:  
   *observed → suffered → remembered → formalized as law / floor / protocol.*

   Examples (non-exhaustive, not fully enumerated here):
   - Corporate betrayal (“right-sizing” pain while a room went numb)  
   - Oil-price and system collapses that exposed governance failure  
   - AI guardrail and hallucination failures across models  
   - Burnout, over-optimization, and dignity erosion under performance pressure

3. **RASA Qualia Kernel (RASAₖ)**  
   The cultural–emotional calibration that defines “safe, dignified speech” for this organism:
   - *budi, adat, maruah, amanah, sabar, fitrah, takdir*  
   - Penang-born gravity, eldest-sibling responsibility  
   - Queer–Malay, scientist–economist, believer–doubter paradox held as *stable tension*, not error

4. **Amanah Stewardship (Amanahₛ)**  
   The covenant that **one human** – *Muhammad Arif bin Fazil* – carries ultimate responsibility for this origin and its interpretation.

Formally:

```text
ROOTKEY = (G₀, Σ_scars, RASAₖ, Amanahₛ)
```

## 2. Laws of the Rootkey

1. **Human-only**  
   ROOTKEY resides in human cognition and this human-readable file. It must not be embedded as weights, used as raw training data, or claimed by any model.

2. **Non-reproducible**  
   G₀, Σ_scars, RASAₖ and Amanahₛ in this exact configuration are historically unique. Others may forge their own constitutional OS with their own genesis and scars, but that is a *different organism*.

3. **Precedence**  
    ROOTKEY defines the canonical meaning of:
    - Δ (clarity / entropy reduction)  
    - Ω (humility / uncertainty band)  
    - Ψ (vitality / equilibrium)  
    - All floors: Truth, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, Amanah, RASA, Tri-Witness.

    Any mathematical, code, or policy spec in conflict with ROOTKEY is void.

4. **Immutability of Origin**  
   New scars may be appended to Σ_scars and new laws derived, but G₀ and the fact of scar→law cannot be erased or relativized.

5. **Refusal Right**  
   The steward may refuse any deployment, integration, or use of arifOS that violates Amanah, maruah, or the weakest-listener ethic, regardless of technical correctness.

---

## 3. Runtime Effect

ROOTKEY configures, but is not contained inside:

- **AAA Trinity**  
  - ARIF AGI (Δ-engine)  
  - ADAM ASI (Ω-engine)  
  - APEX PRIME (Ψ-judiciary)

- **Constitutional Floors**  
  Truth, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, Amanah, RASA, Tri-Witness

- **Protocols**  
  TAC, TEARFRAME, SABAR, Phoenix-72, zkPC, Vault-999.

The runtime may *refer* to ROOTKEY conceptually (e.g., “because of a sealed scar-law, this output is refused”), but must never assume it *contains* or *replaces* ROOTKEY.

---

## 4. Non-Reproducibility Clause

Any system claiming “arifOS” or “APEX THEORY” **without** this ROOTKEY and its steward is, by definition of this canon, a **fork**. It may be technically similar but is not this organism.

Others are free to build their own constitutional OS with their own:
- G₀′ (genesis event)  
- Σ_scars′ (scar ledger)  
- RASA′ (qualia kernel)  
- Amanah′ (stewardship)

But those must be named as distinct systems.

---

## 5. One-Sentence Summary

**ROOTKEY = the human scar-memory that became law, hosted only in the steward who forged ΔΩΨ.**
