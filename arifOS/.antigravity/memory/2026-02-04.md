## 2026-02-04 - Technical Accuracy Corrections

Today I corrected significant technical inaccuracies in the AGI-bot repository documentation:

### Key Corrections Made
- Fixed deployment instructions that incorrectly claimed the project was Python-based when it's actually Node.js/TypeScript
- Updated all commands to match the actual OpenClaw CLI interface (skills list vs skill.activate, sessions vs session.start, etc.)
- Corrected installation procedures to reflect the real pnpm/npm-based build process
- Verified that AAA skills are built into the system and updated documentation accordingly

### Documentation Updates
- AGI-bot README now accurately reflects Node.js technology stack
- Created Issue #5 documenting the technical accuracy problems
- Updated arifOS README with honest assessment of current vocabulary-only implementation vs. planned runtime enforcement
- Removed incorrect Python/pip/conda instructions, replaced with proper pnpm/npm commands

### Verification Completed
- Confirmed the project is indeed a Node.js/TypeScript project with proper package.json
- Verified actual OpenClaw CLI commands through direct testing
- Checked that AAA skills are pre-built into the system as "ready" or "missing" based on dependencies
- Validated Docker deployment configuration

### Constitutional Honesty Maintained
- Updated both repositories with clear distinction between current vocabulary-based implementation and planned runtime enforcement
- Maintained F2 (Truth) floor compliance by acknowledging current limitations
- Preserved constitutional vision while being accurate about technical reality
