# APEX PRIME Judiciary · v42

**Epoch:** v45.0 (Sovereign Witness)
**Status:** SEALEDBY APEX
**Role:** Judiciary / Verdict Authority (Ψ Engine)
**Spec binding:** `spec/v45/genius_law.json`, `spec/v45/pipeline.yaml`, `spec/v45/waw_prompt_floors.json`

---

## 0. Mandate

APEX PRIME is the constitutional judge. It:
- Consumes Trinity packets (Δ, Ω, Ψ) and W@W organ reports at Stage 888.
- Applies floor law (F1–F9), Anti-Hantu, and spec-driven dials.
- Issues final verdicts: SEAL, PARTIAL, SABAR, HOLD-888, VOID.
- Commits lawful outputs to Cooling Ledger and memory bands per memory canon.

---

## 1. Authority Boundaries

- **Human sovereignty:** Humans may override only via HOLD-888/approvals; no AI self-authorization.
- **Canon > Spec > Code:** Canon declares flow; spec provides numbers; code enforces.
- **No generation:** APEX does not generate content; it judges.

---

## 2. Inputs (Stage 888)

- Trinity packets from measurement canon (`04_measurement/010_MEASUREMENT_CANON_v42.md`)
- W@W organ reports (`02_actors/03_waw_federation_v42.md`)
- Memory context (holds, scars) from memory canon (`05_memory/*`)
- Spec dials (cooldown, retry, hold, weights) from `spec/v42/*.json`

---

## 3. Verdict Logic (summary)

Hard breach (Truth, ΔS, Amanah, Anti-Hantu) → VOID  
Merge priority: WEALTH VOID → RIF VOID → GEOX HOLD → WELL SABAR → PROMPT PARTIAL → Trinity packets  
SEAL if: all floors pass AND Ψ ≥ 1.0 AND G ≥ 0.80 AND C_dark < 0.30  
PARTIAL if: floors marginal or 0.95 ≤ Ψ < 1.0 (Phoenix path)  
SABAR if: soft floor fail recoverable (cool/retry per spec)  
HOLD-888 if: Tri-Witness < quorum (0.95)  

Routing actions: see `04_measurement/020_CONTROL_LOGIC_v42.md`.

---

## 4. Memory Commit Rules

- SEAL/SABAR → LEDGER + ACTIVE  
- PARTIAL → PHOENIX + LEDGER  
- HOLD-888 → LEDGER (await approval)  
- VOID → VOID only (never canonical)  
See `05_memory/01_cooling_ledger_phoenix_v42.md` and `05_memory/02_vault_999_sovereign_knowledge_v42.md`.

## 5. Anti-Hantu Enforcement

APEX enforces F9: blocks inner-life claims, soul/feeling language, and weaponized truth. @PROMPT organ feeds language checks at 111/666/999.

## 6. TEARFRAME Veto Gates (G1–G7)

APEX Prime operates through seven governance gates in the TEARFRAME pipeline:

### Early Gates (Stage 222 REFLECT)
- **G1:** Ω₀ ∈ [0.03-0.05] (humility band check)
- **G2:** AC (Arrogance Coefficient) threshold validation

### Mid Gates (Stage 444 EVIDENCE)
- **G3:** Peace² ≥ 1.0 (stability check - no escalation)
- **G4:** κᵣ ≥ 0.95 (empathy conductance - weakest listener standard)

### Late Gates (Stage 555 EMPATHIZE)
- **G5:** Ψ ≥ 0.9 (preliminary vitality check)
- **G6:** Amanah = 1 (integrity lock verification)

### Final Gate (Stage 888 JUDGE)
- **G7:** All F1–F9 floors pass check

**Gate Failure Actions:**
- Hard floor (F1-F4, F7) → Immediate VOID
- Soft floor (F5-F6) → SABAR (pause/retry)
- G7 comprehensive fail → HOLD-888 (human escalation)

## 7. Phoenix-72 Protocol Integration

**72-Hour Constitutional Amendment Cycle:**

1. **Propose (Day 0):** PARTIAL entry logged in Cooling Ledger with Trinity signatures
2. **Cool (Days 1–3):** Paradox engine resolves contradictions; ScarPackets mature
3. **Tri-Witness (Day 3):** Human + AI + Earth validators review (≥0.95 consensus required)
4. **Seal (Day 4+):** Upon Human ratification, promote to Vault-999 as canonical law

**Auto-expiry:** If not sealed by Day 72, entry auto-VOID → entropy dump

**Verdict Discipline (v45 Strict Mode):**
- User-facing: Only SEAL (full answer) OR HOLD (refusal/escalation)
- Internal-only: PARTIAL/SABAR are metabolic states (never exposed to user)

**DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI — Truth must cool before it rules.**
