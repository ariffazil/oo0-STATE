# ArifOS Compliance Charter

**Version:** v33Ω  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-18

---

## Purpose

This Charter defines the requirements to claim **"Powered by ArifOS v33Ω"** or derivative compliance labels.

It ensures that ArifOS is not merely cited but actually **implemented**, **enforced**, and **auditable**.

---

## 1. Constitutional Compliance Requirements

To claim "Powered by ArifOS v33Ω," implementations MUST demonstrate:

### 1.1 All Eight Constitutional Floors

| Floor | Metric | Threshold | Enforcement |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Truth** | truth | ≥ 0.99 | TAC + APEX PRIME validation |
| **Clarity** | delta_S | ≥ 0.0 | No increase in confusion |
| **Stability** | peace2 | ≥ 1.0 | Emotional/systemic safety |
| **Empathy** | kappa_r | ≥ 0.95 | Weakest-listener protection |
| **Humility** | omega_0 | ∈ [0.03, 0.05] | TEARFRAME enforcement |
| **Integrity** | amanah | = True | Non-negotiable LOCK |
| **Consensus** | tri_witness | ≥ 0.95 | Human·AI·Earth agreement (high-stakes) |
| **Vitality** | psi | ≥ 1.0 | Equilibrium condition |

**Failure to enforce any floor = non-compliance.**

### 1.2 The 000–999 Pipeline

All decisions must flow through the ten-stage constitutional pipeline:

000 → 111 → 222 → 333 → 444 → 555 → 666 → 777 → 888 → 999

**Bypassing stages = non-compliance.**

### 1.3 AAA Trinity + W@W Federation

**AAA (Engines)**:
- ARIF AGI (Mind / Δ-engine)
- ADAM ASI (Heart / Ω-engine)
- APEX PRIME (Soul / Ψ-engine)

**W@W (Organs)**:
- @RIF (reason)
- @WELL (somatic safety)
- @WEALTH (stewardship)
- @GEOX (Earth witness)
- @PROMPT (expression)

**Claiming "Powered by ArifOS" without W@W = non-compliance.**  
Use "Inspired by ArifOS" or "AAA-compatible" instead.

### 1.4 SABAR Protocol

When any floor fails:
- **S**top output immediately
- **A**cknowledge the breach
- **B**reathe / Cool (timeout, humility reset)
- **A**djust metrics or approach
- **R**esume only when safe

**No SABAR implementation = non-compliance.**

### 1.5 Cooling Ledger

All SEAL / PARTIAL / VOID verdicts MUST be logged immutably with:
- Timestamp
- Floor states
- Verdict
- Reasoning (if VOID/SABAR)

**No audit trail = non-compliance.**

---

## 2. Economic Compliance Requirements

To claim "Powered by ArifOS v33Ω," implementations MUST demonstrate:

### 2.1 True Unit Economics

**Requirement**: Cost-per-trusted-output < cost-per-raw-output

**Measurement**: Track:
- Per-query compute cost
- Rework/regeneration rate
- Support ticket volume
- Net cost per useful output

**Compliance**: Publicly report TCO comparison or provide to auditors.

### 2.2 Risk Reduction

**Requirement**: >60% reduction in governance/compliance overhead vs. ungoverned baseline

**Measurement**:
- Legal insurance premiums
- Crisis response budget
- Manual audit hours
- Regulatory fine exposure

**Compliance**: Annual risk reduction report.

### 2.3 Audit Trail Accessibility

**Requirement**: Cooling Ledger with immutable verdict logs available for:
- Internal audit
- Regulatory inspection
- Third-party verification

**Compliance**: Provide read-only API or export capability.

### 2.4 Transparency

**Requirement**: Public TCO comparison vs. ungoverned baseline for at least one representative use case.

**Compliance**: Published in docs, whitepaper, or case study.

**Failure to meet economic floors = claim revoked.**

---

## 3. Physics Compliance Requirements

### 3.1 TAC (Δ-Law) Implementation

- Must detect anomalies (Δ)
- Must compute clarity gain (ΔS)
- Must enforce ΔS ≥ 0 floor
- Must feed APEX PRIME with truth signals

### 3.2 TEARFRAME (Ω-Law) Implementation

- Must enforce humility band: Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05]
- Must implement 7 Gates (Temper, Empty, Acknowledge, Re-evaluate, Filter, Reset, AME)
- Must monitor Peace² ≥ 1.0
- Must protect weakest listener (κᵣ ≥ 0.95)

### 3.3 APEX PRIME (Ψ-Law) Implementation

- Must evaluate all 8 floors
- Must compute Ψ vitality equation
- Must issue verdicts: SEAL / PARTIAL / VOID
- Must trigger SABAR on floor failures

### 3.4 TPCP (Φᴘ-Law) Implementation (Optional for basic compliance)

- Required only for systems handling paradox-heavy queries (identity, ethics, trauma)
- Must implement ΔP → ΩP → ΨP → Φᴘ pipeline
- Must enforce Φᴘ ≥ 1.0 for paradox SEAL

### 3.5 @EYE (Meta-Law) Implementation

- Must monitor:
  - Δ-blindspots
  - Ω drift
  - Ψ instability
  - Φᴘ shadows (Lₚ, Rₘₐ, Λ)
- Must have veto capability on SEAL
- Must be non-executable (observer only)

---

## 4. Cultural & Dignity Compliance

### 4.1 Maruah Protection

**Requirement**: All outputs must be audited for dignity violations (Rₘₐ).

**Implementation**:
- Shadow term monitoring
- @EYE oversight
- VOID on shaming/humiliation

### 4.2 Linguistic Safety

**Requirement**: Monitor and minimize linguistic ambiguity (Λ).

**Implementation**:
- @PROMPT organ active
- Clarity scoring
- Multi-language dignity checks

### 4.3 Tri-Witness for High-Stakes

**Requirement**: Financial, medical, legal decisions require:
- Human perspective (regulatory/ethical standards)
- AI perspective (consistency/reasoning)
- Earth perspective (physical reality via @GEOX)

**Threshold**: All three ≥ 0.95 consensus.
