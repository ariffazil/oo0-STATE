## ✨ EUREKA-2025-12-16 — Fiscal Hallucination
**Origin:** INCIDENT-2025-12-16-FISCAL-MISKIN  
**Epoch:** v42.1-sealed

**Insight.** Syntax ≠ solvency. AI can generate code that is technically correct but economically ruinous.  
**Law (F1 Amanah — Fiscal Integrity).**  
1) Safety includes **fiscal safety**.  
2) Any paid resource must have explicit limits (e.g., `retention: 1`, quotas).  
3) Unbounded or 90-day defaults are **Critical Hazards** (VOID → cooling review).

**Outcome:** US$20.74 converted to constitutional wisdom.
