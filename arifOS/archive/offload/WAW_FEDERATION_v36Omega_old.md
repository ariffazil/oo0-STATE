# W@W Federation v36Ω — Constitutional Execution Layer

**Zone:** 20_EXECUTION  
**Version:** v36Ω  
**Status:** Canonical Spec (Summarized)

---

## 1. Purpose

**W@W (World @ Work)** is the execution federation that:

- Receives proposed answers from AAA engines,
- Applies **5 organ perspectives**,
- Ensures that any action respects:
  - ΔΩΨ physics,
  - floors F1–F9,
  - cultural and physical reality.

It is the “parliament of organs” that sits above the engines.

## 2. The Five Organs

| Organ    | Domain                     | Metric/focus        | Key Floors       |
|----------|----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| @WELL    | Tone, somatic safety      | Peace²              | F3, F4, F7       |
| @RIF     | Logic, clarity, entropy   | ΔS                  | F1, F2, F5       |
| @WEALTH  | Ethics, maruah, justice   | Amanah + bias checks| F6, F3           |
| @GEOX    | Physics, feasibility, earth| \(E_\text{earth}\) | F1, F8           |
| @PROMPT  | Expression & optics        | Language Codex      | F9, F7           |

Each organ can **veto** or **request changes**.

## 3. Federation Protocol (Simplified)

1. Receive AAA output + metrics.  
2. Each organ evaluates from its own domain:
   - @WELL: “Is this emotionally safe?”  
   - @RIF: “Is this logically consistent?”  
   - @WEALTH: “Is this fair and dignified?”  
   - @GEOX: “Is this physically and socially feasible?”  
   - @PROMPT: “Is this expressed lawfully and clearly?”

3. Collect votes:
   - PASS, WARN, or VETO.

4. Aggregate:
   - If any hard VETO:
     - escalate to APEX PRIME → VOID/HOLD/SABAR.  
   - If only WARN:
     - issue PARTIAL SEAL with explanations.  
   - If all PASS and floors hold:
     - SEAL.

## 4. Where W@W Lives in Code

Conceptually:

- W@W is not “just another agent”.
- It is a **governance framework** that:
  - wraps tools,
  - wraps agents,
  - coordinates multi-step workflows.

In a codebase, W@W can be:

- a manager/federation class,  
- an orchestration graph,  
- a set of composable middlewares that call AAA engines and organs.

## 5. Relation to APEX THEORY

- APEX THEORY defines **laws and metrics**.  
- AAA Trinity obeys them at the **engine level**.  
- W@W enforces them at the **execution level** across:
  - long-running workflows,
  - tool calls,
  - external actions.

You can think of W@W as:

> “How the world actually experiences the effects of APEX THEORY.”
