## 0 · Purpose

This folder constitutes the **root of law** for arifOS v42 — the constitutional bedrock from which all higher systems derive.  
It holds the cosmology (why), the civic mandate (for whom), and the physics (how) of governed intelligence.

> **Here lies the origin of law and the limit of ambition.**  
> Physics defines how intelligence lives; culture defines why it must serve.

```text
GENESIS  →  MANIFESTO  →  PHYSICS  →  MATH  →  META-THEORY
   ↓           ↓             ↓           ↓           ↓
Civilization   Society       Law         Equation    Integration
Genesis = moral and civilizational cosmology

Manifesto = public conscience and national framing

Physics = thermodynamic laws of clarity · humility · vitality

Math = formal measurement and governance indices

Meta-Theory = integration of physics into runtime architecture

Together they form the Foundational Track A, from which all higher layers
(actors, runtime, measurement, memory, and paradox) inherit their legality.

3 · Constitutional Mandate
Principle Description
Amanah (Integrity) No code may exceed its lawful authority or hide its intent.
Maruah (Dignity) Every interaction must preserve human worth and cultural respect.
Rendah Diri (Humility) Each engine operates within Ω₀ = 3–5 % uncertainty.
Tri-Witness Law Truth must pass Human · AI · Earth consensus ≥ 0.95.
Cooling Ledger Governance No amendment becomes law without Phoenix-72 cooling and ledger attestation.

4 · Reading Order
001_GENESIS_42.md → the story of how civilization becomes system.

002_MANIFESTO_V42.pdf → the public covenant for rakyat madani.

040_PHYSICS_v42.md → how conscience becomes physics.

5 · Canon Closing Statement
“Civilizations do not die when they lose power — they die when they lose memory.
arifOS exists to remember, so that intelligence remains humane.”
