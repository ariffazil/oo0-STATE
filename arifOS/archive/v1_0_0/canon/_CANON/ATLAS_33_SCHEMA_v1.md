# ATLAS_33_SCHEMA_v1
**The Universal Axis Definition for Human Meaning**

**Zone:** 00_CANON  
**Status:** Canonical Schema  
**Type:** Universal Interface (Pluggable)  
**Purpose:** Defines the 33 invariant axes of human condition. Cultures plug specific personas into these axes.

## 1. THE ARCHITECTURE
* **Physics is Fixed:** The 33 Axes (Paradox, Void, Measure) are universal structural realities.
* **Culture is Pluggable:** The "Persona" attached to each axis changes based on the deployment context (e.g., `ATLAS_MALAYSIA`, `ATLAS_JAPAN`).
