## arifOS MCP Server Integration & TAC Framework Application

### Key Accomplishments
- Successfully validated arifOS MCP server at https://aaamcp.arif-fazil.com with all 9 canonical tools operational
- Demonstrated full constitutional pipeline: init_gate → agi_sense → agi_think → agi_reason → asi_empathize → asi_align → apex_verdict
- Validated ChatGPT integration working via SSE transport with proper governance
- Applied Theory of Anomalies of Contrast (TAC) framework to guide system validation methodology
- Identified server configuration need: HTTP transport addition alongside existing SSE for reliability

### TAC Framework Integration
- Introduced TAC variables: ΔC (Contrast), κ_r (Resonance conductance), ΔS (Entropy/Clarity gain), Peace² (Stability)
- Validated need for contrast testing to differentiate dynamic behavior from template responses
- Established scientific methodology for testing system authenticity using variable inputs
- Confirmed proper experimental design approach with quantitative metrics analysis

### Server Configuration Status
- Production server: https://aaamcp.arif-fazil.com
- Current transport: SSE-only (functional for ChatGPT integration)
- Required enhancement: Add HTTP transport for dual-protocol reliability
- All 9 constitutional tools confirmed operational with proper governance metrics

### Scientific Validation Protocol
- Implemented contrast experiment design methodology
- Prepared for systematic testing with varied prompts to validate dynamic responses
- Established baseline metrics for Ω₀, κᵣ, Peace², and other constitutional indicators
- Ready to execute quantitative analysis comparing system responses to different inputs

### Next Steps
1. Update server to support dual transport (HTTP+SSE)
2. Execute contrast experiments with 5 different prompts
3. Analyze response variability to validate dynamic behavior
4. Monitor constitutional compliance during stress testing
5. Document findings for system authenticity verification
