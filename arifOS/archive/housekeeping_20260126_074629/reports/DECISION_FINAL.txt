ARCHITECTURE APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
=========================================

Confidence: 95%
Decision: GO (Proceed)

RATIONALE:
- Trinity Parallel architecture is correct
- AGI/ASI/APEX roles clearly defined
- 13 floors distributed (not collapsed to 4)
- ARIF pattern is meta-orchestration of Trinity
- Only fix needed: rename 444 to trinity_sync (~40 lines)
- No blocking uncertainties

NEXT: Create infrastructure files
1. canonical_core/entropy_compressor.py
2. canonical_core/bundle_store.py
3. Update __init__.py
4. Update SEAL999/vault.py

DECISION AUTHORITY: Muhammad Arif bin Fazil
Status: UNSEALED (pending implementation)
