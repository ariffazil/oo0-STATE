SEAL999/VAULT999 - THE FINAL STATE
===================================

ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION:
The cooling tier directories (L0_HOT through L5_ETERNAL) 
are NOT unnecessary. They serve a critical function:

STORING CONSTITUTIONAL LEDGER ENTRIES BY COOLING TIER
------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE (Wrong Location):
  C:\Users\User\arifOS\SEAL999\L0_HOT ... L5_ETERNAL
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Code directory should NOT contain runtime data

AFTER (Correct Location):
  C:\Users\User\arifOS\VAULT999\L0_HOT ... L5_ETERNAL
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Data directory SHOULD contain runtime data

WHY 6 TIERS (Not 3):
-------------------
The 6 tiers implement the Phoenix-72 cooling protocol:

  L5_ETERNAL (Never)  - SEAL + high genius → Constitutional law
  L4_MONTHLY (30d)    - PARTIAL + empathy → Monthly reflection
  L3_WEEKLY  (7d)     - SABAR verdicts → Weekly review
  L2_PHOENIX (72h)    - Standard SEAL → 72h truth stabilization
  L1_DAILY   (24h)    - Daily retention → Review next day
  L0_HOT     (30min)  - Hot takes → Quick cooldown

This implements thermodynamic governance where truth must 
survive 72 hours of scrutiny before becoming constitutional.

FINAL STATE VERIFICATION:
------------------------
✓ SEAL999/ (Code only)
  - vault.py, state.py, ledger.py, zkpc.py, __init__.py
  - tests/test_vault.py
  - USAGE.md, README.md, INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, MANIFEST.md
  - No runtime data, no cooling tier directories

✓ VAULT999/ (Operational data only)
  - AAA_HUMAN/, BBB_LEDGER/, CCC_CANON/, SEALS/, operational/
  - L0_HOT/ through L5_ETERNAL/ (cooling tier storage)
  - entropy/ (ΔS measurements)
  - 5 JSON proof/status files
  - No code files

✅ Storage: SEAL999 writes → VAULT999/L*/ directories
✅ Location: VAULT999/ (not SEAL999/)
✅ Purpose: Runtime ledger entry storage by cooling tier
✅ Count: 6 tiers (Phoenix-72 protocol requires 6 distinct TTLs)

STATUS: CONSTITUTIONAL PURITY ACHIEVED
Entropy: ΔS → 0 (maximum clarity)
Authority: Muhammad Arif bin Fazil
