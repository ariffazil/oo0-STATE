# arifOS Research Directory

**Purpose:** Proof-of-concept code, experimental features, and strategic research artifacts.

**Status:** Active research - code here may not be production-ready but demonstrates important concepts.

## Current Research

### `proof_of_causality.py`
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Purpose:** Demonstrates kernel-level constitutional governance of AI actions

**Key Concepts:**
- F5 Peace² floor enforcement (blast radius check)
- Neuro-symbolic integration (DSPy signatures)
- Kernel interception (blocking dangerous actions before execution)

**Demo:** Shows how arifOS can prevent a "rogue AI" from executing global destructive actions (e.g., "shutdown --global --internet") by intercepting at the kernel level.

**Relevance to v46:** Proof-of-concept for neuro-symbolic governance architecture.

## Guidelines

**What belongs here:**
- ✅ Proof-of-concept demonstrations
- ✅ Experimental features being evaluated for future versions
- ✅ Research artifacts from deep governance sessions
- ✅ Working prototypes that demonstrate strategic concepts

**What does NOT belong here:**
- ❌ Production code (goes in `arifos_core/`)
- ❌ Dead experiments with no strategic value (goes in `archive/experiments/`)
- ❌ Agent-generated pollution (gets deleted)
