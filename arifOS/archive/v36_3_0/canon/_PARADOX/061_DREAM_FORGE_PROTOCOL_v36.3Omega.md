# 061_DREAM_FORGE_PROTOCOL_v36.3Omega.md

Zone: 06_PARADOX
Status: CANON — SEALED
Epoch: v36.3Omega

Implements:
  - 060_PARADOX_ENGINE_PHYSICS_v36.3Omega.md
  - PARADOX_777_CUBE_v36.3Omega.md
  - DREAMFORGE_ARCHITECTURE_v36.3Omega.md
  - MEASUREMENT_APEX_STANDARDS_v36.3Omega.md
  - GOV_META_v36.3Omega.md
  - PHOENIX72_PROTOCOL_v36.3Omega.md

Precedence:
  - If any wording here conflicts with:
      * PARADOX_777_CUBE_v36.3Omega.md
      * PP_PS_WAVE_CODEX_v35Omega.md
    THEN the 70_PARADOX canon + PP_PS WAVE take precedence.

Role:
  - Define the Dream Forge protocol — the procedural pipeline by which an EUREKA_CANDIDATE from 777 is refined into a Phoenix-ready amendment proposal.
  - Dream Forge is a lab, not a legislative chamber. It produces candidate insights, never canon.

## 1. IDENTITY — What is Dream Forge?

Dream Forge is the constitutional workshop where paradoxes cooled by 777 are:

- aligned,
- expanded,
- stress-tested,
- eliminated or refined,
- shaped into lawful amendment proposals.

Dream Forge cannot change canon.
Dream Forge cannot bypass Phoenix-72.
Dream Forge exists to prepare insights for judgment, not to enact them.

It is governed by the O-TASK cycle, a four-stage process.

## 2. INPUT — EUREKA_CANDIDATE Packet

Dream Forge accepts only packets where:

- Phi_p >= 1.0 (from 060 Physics)
- Floors remained intact during cooling
- APEX PRIME has not pre-VOIDed the candidate

A EUREKA_CANDIDATE minimally includes:

- scar_id
- paradox_fields: DeltaP, OmegaP, PsiP
- load_fields: L_p, R_m, Lambda
- resulting Phi_p
- impact assessments (human, AI, earth)
- 777 cooling path trace
- proposed insight (first crystallization)
- floor impacts (which floors it strengthens/weakens)

This protocol does not define formats — those live in:
  - spec/dreamforge_otask_spec_v36.3O.yaml

## 3. THE O-TASK CYCLE — Four Constitutional Phases

Dream Forge operates using a tetra-phase loop:

### 3.1 Phase O-ALIGN — Context & Constraint Alignment

Purpose:
Ensure the paradox is understood in full constitutional context.

Tasks:
  - reconstruct the original Scar narrative
  - read the paradox trace and cooling history
  - map affected canon sections
  - identify relevant thresholds and floors
  - clarify jurisdiction (Delta, Omega, Psi)

Outputs:
  - aligned_context
  - constraints_map
  - canonical_scope

Rules:
  - No amendment drafting allowed.
  - No interpretation overrides canon.

### 3.2 Phase O-FORGE — Option Generation (Creative Divergence)

Purpose:
Generate multiple possible ways to resolve or improve the system.

Tasks:
  - generate amendment options
  - generate spec refinements
  - generate runtime guidance options
  - generate alternative 777 mappings
  - produce interpretive clarifications
  - propose measurement adjustments (without setting numbers)

Outputs:
  - options[] = { option, rationale, floor_impact_estimate }

Rules:
  - ARIF-Delta may propose structural options
  - ADAM-Omega may propose empathetic framing
  - LLM may act as Metabolizer, not Judge
  - APEX PRIME only observes; no verdict yet

Forbidden:
  - changing canon text
  - selecting a winner
  - dropping floors

### 3.3 Phase O-STRIKE — Stress Test & Elimination (Convergent Pressure)

Purpose:
Destroy weak options through high-pressure testing.

Tasks:
  - run each option against floors and Tri-Witness
  - check for contradictions with 777 geometry, Phoenix protocol, existing canon
  - run adversarial hypotheticals
  - evaluate human/earth impacts

Outputs:
  - survivors[]
  - eliminated[] with reasons
  - updated floor impact projections

Rules:
  - No option survives unless DeltaS >= 0 and Peace^2 >= 1.
  - If all options fail, packet returns to 777 as HOTSPOT.

### 3.4 Phase O-QUENCH — Final Cooling & Recommendation

Purpose:
Cool the surviving option into a Phoenix-ready object.

Tasks:
  - collapse survivors into one proposed amendment object OR a small recommendation set
  - prepare justification trace
  - ensure DeltaS gain stable, Peace^2 >= 1, kappa_r within band, Amanah LOCK unbroken

Outputs:
  - phoenix_candidate with:
    - amendment type (canon/spec/runtime)
    - affected canon ranges
    - justification
    - DeltaS / Peace^2 / kappa_r projections
    - Tri-Witness preview
    - human/earth impact summaries

Rules:
  - All outputs remain non-binding until Phoenix-72.
  - No canonical text is edited here.

## 4. SAFETY RULES

Dream Forge is a quarantined environment:

- No user-facing output.
- LLM forbidden to claim identity/agency (Anti-Hantu).
- No suggestion may reduce safeguards.
- No path may weaken floors.
- No contradiction to established physics or geometry.
- No automatic updates — everything must pass Phoenix-72.

If Dream Forge produces nothing stable, the paradox returns to 777 as HOTSPOT.

## 5. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CANONS

Depends On:
  - 060_PARADOX_ENGINE_PHYSICS_v36.3Omega.md
  - PARADOX_777_CUBE_v36.3Omega.md
  - MEASUREMENT_APEX_STANDARDS_v36.3Omega.md
  - GOV_META_v36.3Omega.md
  - PHOENIX-72 protocol canon

Feeds Into:
  - Phoenix-72
  - Vault-999
  - Potential Spec updates
  - Potential Runtime guidance

Does NOT Do:
  - amend canon
  - modify floors
  - set measurement formulae
  - change 777 geometry
  - act as APEX PRIME
