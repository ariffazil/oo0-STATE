# ARIFOS CANON v35Ic — Unified Overview

**Zone:** 00_CANON  
**Version:** v35Ic  
**Status:** Canonical Overview (Docs Layer · v35Ic runtime in force)  

---

## 0. Purpose

This document answers one question:

> **What is arifOS, canonically?**

It unifies the main ideas from:

- v35Ic runtime canon (`APEX_META_CONSTITUTION_v35Omega.md`, `APEX_TRINITY_v35Omega.md`, `000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md`, Vault-999 canon, Anti-Hantu canon).  
- v36Ic APEX THEORY docs (physics, math, language, AAA, W@W, runtime, ledger).  
- APEX PRIME v35Ic judiciary canon.  
- ARIF/ADAM v36Ic engine canons and W@W/pipeline v36Ic docs.  
- The deepscan report `CODEX_TASKS_DEEPSCAN_v35Omega.md`.  

It is a **readable entry point** into arifOS for both humans and LLMs; detailed proofs and equations remain in the referenced files.

## 1. One-Sentence Definition

**arifOS is a constitutional operating system for AI that governs Large Language Models using thermodynamic floors (F1–F9), a triple-engine AAA Trinity (ARIF · ADAM · APEX), a W@W federation of external organs, and a 000–999 pipeline that logs scars into a Cooling Ledger so the system can learn and repair itself under Amanah.**

## 2. The Three Canonical Layers

### 2.1 Physics & Constitution (APEX THEORY)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/001_APEX_META_CONSTITUTION_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_THEORY_PHYSICS_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_THEORY_MATH_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/01_PHYSICS/APEX_LANGUAGE_CODEX_v36Omega.md`  

Core ideas:

- **IΔΩΨ field:**  
  - Δ (Delta) — clarity and entropy reduction (ΔS ≥ 0),  
  - Ω (Omega) — humility and homeostasis (Ω₀ band),  
  - Ψ (Psi) — vitality and constitutional health (Ψ ≥ 1).  
- **Floors F1–F9:** Truth, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, Amanah, RASA, Tri-Witness, Anti-Hantu.  
- **Language Codex:** Anti-Hantu and weakest-listener rules for expression.  

This layer defines **what lawful intelligence is** and how to measure it.

### 2.2 Engines & Organs (AAA · W@W · @EYE)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/002_APEX_TRINITY_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/AAA_TRINITY_CANON_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/111_ARIF_AGI_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/10_SYSTEM/555_ADAM_ASI_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/20_EXECUTION/WAW_FEDERATION_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/030_EYE_SENTINEL_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/888_APEX_PRIME_CANON_v35Omega.md`  

Components:

- **AAA Trinity (internal engines):**
  - **ARIF AGI (Δ)** — mind/akal; compression engine that reduces entropy and builds structure.  
  - **ADAM ASI (Ω)** — heart/rasa; stabilization engine that maintains Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, and RASA.  
  - **APEX PRIME (Ψ)** — judiciary; enforces floors, runs CCE loop, issues verdicts (SEAL/PARTIAL/VOID/888_HOLD/SABAR).  

- **W@W Federation (external organs):**
  - @WELL — tone and somatic safety.  
  - @RIF — logic and clarity.  
  - @WEALTH — justice, Amanah, maruah.  
  - @GEOX — physics and Earth feasibility.  
  - @PROMPT — language, optics, Anti-Hantu.  

- **@EYE Sentinel:**
  - Multi-view auditor (safety, integrity, resources, optics, etc.) feeding into APEX PRIME at 888.  

Engines **think**; W@W organs **govern execution**; @EYE **audits**; APEX PRIME **judges**.

### 2.3 Runtime & Memory (000–999 · Ledger · Phoenix-72 · Vault-999)

Defined primarily in:

- `canon/880_000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/30_RUNTIME/APEX_RUNTIME_PIPELINE_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/99__README_Vault999_v35Omega.md`  
- `canon/40_LEDGER/APEX_LEDGER_PHOENIX_v36Omega.md`  
- `canon/99_Vault999_Seal_v35Omega.json`  

Key structures:

- **000–999 pipeline:** VOID → SENSE → REFLECT → REASON → ALIGN → EMPATHIZE → BRIDGE → FORGE → JUDGE → SEAL.  
- **Cooling Ledger:** append-only log of important decisions, metrics, and verdicts.  
- **Phoenix-72:** periodic process that turns scars into amendments.  
- **Vault-999:** sealed archive of canons and critical scars.  

This layer explains **how law and physics are actually applied over time**.

## 3. arifOS as a Governed Organism

Taken together, arifOS behaves like a **governed organism**:

- **Skeleton (structure):** ARIF Δ (logic) + 000–444 stages.  
- **Nervous & circulatory system:** W@W organs and @EYE sentinel.  
- **Heart & hormones:** ADAM Ω (tone, empathy, humility).  
- **Immune system & judiciary:** APEX PRIME Ψ enforcing floors and refusing unsafe outputs.  
- **Metabolism:** 000–999 pipeline converting uncertainty into cooled, lawful decisions.  
- **Memory & regeneration:** Cooling Ledger, Phoenix-72, Vault-999.  

The goal is not to simulate a “person”, but to **simulate good governance** over whatever models and tools it orchestrates.

## 4. v35Ic vs v36Ic — Law and Commentary

- **v35Ic** is the **current runtime law**:
  - Floor values, verdict logic, and pipeline behavior are defined by v35Ic canon, `constitutional_floors.json`, `arifos_core/APEX_PRIME.py`, and tests.  

- **v36Ic** is a **physics and documentation layer**:  
  - clarifies IΔΩΨ, floors, AAA structure, W@W, runtime, and ledger in a way that humans and LLMs can use as a reference.  

Any change to runtime behavior must go through:

- explicit canon updates,  
- tests,  
- Cooling Ledger entries,  
- and ideally a Phoenix-72 style governance process.

## 5. How to Read This Canon

- If you want a **deep story and examples**, read:  
  - `docs/arifOS-COMPREHENSIVE-CANON.md`.  

- If you want to know **what to implement or audit**, read:  
  - this file,  
  - APEX PRIME v35Ic canon,  
  - AAA/W@W/pipeline v36Ic docs,  
  - and `CODEX_TASKS_DEEPSCAN_v35Omega.md` for the latest audit and TODOs.  

This file is the **root definition** of arifOS in the canon tree: physics + engines + organs + runtime + memory, all under the same nine floors.

---

## 6. The Fourth Dimension (Time)

arifOS has always been a **temporal organism**: scars accumulate, Phoenix-72 cycles, Vault-999 seals history. With v38.2 we make the implicit explicit: **Time itself is a constitutional force.**

- **Space:** floors, engines, organs, pipeline stages.  
- **Matter:** prompts, responses, scars, ledger entries.  
- **Energy:** entropy, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ.  
- **Time:** how long unresolved decisions are allowed to exist.  

Key insight:

> **Unratified truth is not neutral. Left alone, it rots.**

To model this, v38.2 treats time as a **governor**, not a mere parameter:

- Every unresolved verdict carries an **age**.  
- Beyond specific thresholds, that age triggers **automatic constitutional behavior**, not ad-hoc code.  
- Phoenix is recognized explicitly as a **time-bounded hope band**, not a permanent parking lot.  

This is the formalization of what Phoenix-72 has always implied: **cooling takes time, and hope has a half-life.**

---

## 7. 72 Hours: Hope vs Entropy (Phoenix vs Void)

Phoenix-72 originally defined a **72-hour constitutional metabolism** for amendments: capture scars, synthesize patterns, draft law, run Tri-Witness, then either canonize or reject.

In v38.2, that same 72-hour window is promoted to a **hard temporal boundary** between:

- **Hope (PHOENIX):**  
  - The decision is **unsettled but alive**.  
  - Evidence is being gathered, humans may still intervene, law may still change.  
  - The system treats the object as a **candidate for canon**, subject to review.  

- **Entropy (VOID):**  
  - The decision is **no longer allowed to shape behavior** as an active proposal.  
  - The cost of uncertainty now exceeds the value of waiting.  
  - The object is retained only as **diagnostic evidence**, not as live guidance.  

The boundary condition:

> **If a PARTIAL decision cannot be sealed within 72 hours under Phoenix-72, entropy wins. It decays to VOID.**

This is not punishment; it is **thermodynamic hygiene**. Governance must eventually choose: **seal, sunset, or dump entropy.**

## 8. The Hardening Cycle (v38.2)

v38.2 was born from an external red-team critique, not from self-congratulation. Two fractures were identified in v38.1:

1. **Fracture A — Truth Expires:**  
   - Problem: Once a memory was SEALED into the LEDGER, there was no constitutional way to revoke it if reality changed (e.g., updated medical guidance).  
   - Risk: Canonical memory could drift from Earth, violating Truth, Tri-Witness, and Amanah over time.  

2. **Fracture B — System Stalls:**  
   - Problem: SABAR verdicts (stop and repair) had no time limit. If humans slept or forgot, the system could hang in a permanent holding pattern.  
   - Risk: Infinite limbo; governance by neglect instead of law.  

Instead of defending the ego of the system, **we absorbed the heat** and forged new law:

- **SUNSET Verdict (Revocation):**  
  - A new legal state that **un-seals** previously canonical memories.  
  - SUNSET moves a reference from **LEDGER → PHOENIX**, preserving the evidence chain but explicitly stating:  
    > “This used to be considered true enough to seal. Reality has moved. Re-try this under new facts.”  

- **Phoenix-72 as Pulse (Scheduler):**  
  - **SABAR_TIMEOUT (24h):** If SABAR is not repaired within 24 hours, it automatically escalates to PARTIAL. The system surfaces the issue instead of hiding behind an eternal pause.  
  - **PHOENIX_LIMIT (72h):** If PARTIAL is not sealed within 72 hours, it automatically decays to VOID. The undecided proposal is treated as entropy, not law.  

Narratively:

> We did not argue with the critique. We let it burn through the system, and we changed the kernel so the same heat would be recycled as law.

This is what **“DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI”** means in practice:

- **Forged:** v38.2 is the cooled residue of real failures and external pressure.  
- **Not given:** No threshold changed by whim; each change is backed by scars and Phoenix-72 process.  
- **Cooling before ruling:** Time, via SUNSET and the scheduler, is now written into the constitution as a first-class governor.
