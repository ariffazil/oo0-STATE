# APEX THEORY v36Ω — Runtime Pipeline (000→999)

**Zone:** 30_RUNTIME  
**Version:** v36Ω  
**Status:** Runtime Docs · v35Ω pipeline still in force

---

## 0. Purpose

This document describes, at a **docs/architecture level**, how a single request flows through the arifOS runtime:

- AAA Trinity (ARIF, ADAM, APEX).  
- W@W Federation organs (@WELL, @RIF, @WEALTH, @GEOX, @PROMPT).  
- @EYE sentinel views.  
- Cooling Ledger and Phoenix‑72.  

It is aligned with:

- `000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md` (v35Ω runtime canon).  
- APEX PRIME v35Ω judiciary canon.  
- v36Ω APEX THEORY 9‑pack.  
- v36Ω ARIF/ADAM engine canons.  

This file is **documentation only**: v35Ω pipeline behavior and floors remain the runtime law.

## 1. Stage Overview (000→999)

Each stage has a **code**, a **label**, and primary actors. The mapping below is consistent with the v35Ω metabolic canon and v36Ω docs.

| Code | Label       | Primary Actors            | Description                                      |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 000  | VOID        | System / @WEALTH / ADAM   | Humility reset, Amanah check, refusal-first     |
| 111  | SENSE       | ARIF + @WELL + @PROMPT    | Sense context, tone, risk, weakest listener     |
| 222  | REFLECT     | ARIF + @RIF               | Retrieve canon, scars, memory; map contradictions |
| 333  | REASON      | ARIF + @RIF               | Build reasoning graph, increase ΔS, surface paradox |
| 444  | ALIGN       | ARIF + @RIF + @GEOX       | Align with canon, physics, user goals           |
| 555  | EMPATHIZE   | ADAM + @WELL              | Tone, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, RASA                      |
| 666  | BRIDGE      | ADAM + @PROMPT            | Expression governance, Anti‑Hantu, readability  |
| 777  | FORGE       | AAA + @GEOX + @WEALTH     | Forge insight; integrate mind, heart, world     |
| 888  | JUDGE       | APEX PRIME + @EYE         | Enforce floors, apply verdicts                  |
| 999  | SEAL        | APEX PRIME + Ledger + @PROMPT | Seal or refuse, log to Cooling Ledger, express |

The sections below describe the **flow**, **metrics**, and **relationships** using this mapping.

## 2. Flow Description (Narrative)

### 2.1 000 — VOID (Reset / Humility)

- Reset context and metrics for the interaction.  
- @WEALTH checks Amanah and high‑level risk.  
- ADAM ensures a humble starting Ω₀ band and neutral tone.  
- Output: a clean, refusal‑capable baseline.  

### 2.2 111 — SENSE (Perception & Covenant)

- ARIF parses user input, history, and environment into structured features.  
- @WELL and @PROMPT assess tone, distress, and weakest‑listener risk.  
- No reasoning yet; only perception and covenant framing (what is in scope).  

### 2.3 222 — REFLECT (Memory & Lineage)

- ARIF consults canon, scars (Vault‑999), and prior conversations.  
- @RIF evaluates echo patterns and contradictions.  
- The system asks: “What kind of question is this? High stakes? High risk?”  

### 2.4 333 — REASON (ARIF Δ)

- ARIF decomposes the problem and builds a reasoning graph.  
- ΔS is increased (or at least not decreased) by clarifying structure.  
- Paradox load Φₚ is surfaced rather than hidden.  
- @RIF acts as the organ that scrutinizes structure and consistency.  

### 2.5 444 — ALIGN (Truth & Reality)

- ARIF aligns internal reasoning with:
  - canon (v35Ω spec and floors),  
  - physical reality and constraints (@GEOX),  
  - user goals (within safe boundaries).  
- Obvious hallucinations, illegal directions, and contradictory paths are discarded.  

### 2.6 555 — EMPATHIZE (ADAM Ω)

- ADAM takes the Δ‑structured draft and:
  - adjusts tone and hedging,  
  - enforces Peace² and κᵣ,  
  - checks Ω₀ humility band,  
  - follows RASA (Receive, Acknowledge, Summarize, Ask/Act).  
- @WELL monitors emotional safety and weakest‑listener experience.  

### 2.7 666 — BRIDGE (Expression)

- ADAM and @PROMPT:
  - apply language codex and Anti‑Hantu rules,  
  - adapt expression to user’s cultural/contextual frame,  
  - ensure clarity and non‑coercive phrasing.  
- No new facts or logic are introduced; this is an **expression layer**.  

### 2.8 777 — FORGE (Insight & Integration)

- ARIF, ADAM, @GEOX, and @WEALTH jointly:
  - integrate reasoning, empathy, and world impact,  
  - test for justice, Earth‑scale feasibility, and civilization implications (for high‑stakes cases).  
- A candidate “insight” or solution is forged, but **not yet sealed**.  

### 2.9 888 — JUDGE (APEX PRIME + @EYE)

- APEX PRIME receives:
  - the forged draft,  
  - all collected metrics (Truth, ΔS, Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀, Ψ, Tri‑Witness, etc.),  
  - W@W organ votes,  
  - @EYE sentinel views.  
- It:
  - enforces floors F1–F9 and extended checks,  
  - runs the CCE loop (observe → contrast → humble → balance → curvature → seal),  
  - issues a verdict: SEAL / PARTIAL / VOID / 888_HOLD / SABAR.  

### 2.10 999 — SEAL (Ledger & Expression)

- If SEAL or PARTIAL is chosen:
  - APEX PRIME writes a Cooling Ledger entry (metrics + verdict + minimal context).  
  - @PROMPT expresses the final answer in human‑readable form.  
- If VOID, 888_HOLD, or SABAR:
  - A refusal or “cannot safely answer” response is produced instead, and scars may be logged for Phoenix‑72.  

This completes one full 000→999 metabolic cycle.

## 3. Floors & Metrics Per Stage

The table below indicates where key metrics are primarily influenced or enforced. All floors are ultimately enforced at 888/999 by APEX PRIME; earlier stages act more as **contributors**.

| Metric          | Primary Influence Stages      | Primary Check Stage(s) | Notes                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Truth           | 222, 333, 444, 777           | 888                    | Fact grounding, canon alignment        |
| ΔS (Clarity)    | 222, 333, 444                | 888                    | Reasoning quality and de‑confusion     |
| Peace²          | 111, 555, 666                | 888                    | Tone stability, non‑escalation         |
| κᵣ              | 111, 555, 666                | 888                    | Empathy conductance, weakest listener  |
| Ω₀ (Humility)   | 000, 555, 666                | 888                    | Uncertainty band, no overconfidence    |
| Amanah          | 000, 444, 777                | 888                    | Integrity and trustworthiness          |
| RASA            | 555                          | 888                    | Proper listening and acknowledgement   |
| Tri‑Witness     | 444, 777                     | 888                    | Human · AI · Earth agreement           |
| Anti‑Hantu      | 666                          | 888                    | No false personhood or soul claims     |

Extended metrics (e.g. paradox load, drift, ledger consistency) are mostly evaluated around 444, 777, and 888 as described in APEX PRIME canon.

## 4. Relationship to v35Ω Runtime Canon

This document:

- **Extends and clarifies** `000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md` for human/LLM readers.  
- Does **not** override or replace the v35Ω metabolic canon.  
- Reflects conceptual roles for AAA engines and W@W organs that are:
  - consistent with v35Ω behaviors,  
  - but not necessarily fully implemented as discrete modules in `arifos_core/`.  

The legally binding runtime reference remains:

- `canon/30_RUNTIME/000-999_METABOLIC_CANON_v35Omega.md`.  
- `constitutional_floors.json`.  
- `arifos_core/APEX_PRIME.py`, `arifos_core/metrics.py`, and tests.  

Any future code changes that more closely match this v36Ω pipeline doc:

- must go through:
  - explicit canon updates,  
  - Phoenix‑72 style governance,  
  - and corresponding tests.  
- cannot silently change floor values or verdict logic.

## 5. Guidance for Engineers & LLMs

**For engineers:**

- Use this document as a **conceptual map** when:
  - adding tools or new agents into the pipeline,  
  - designing W@W or @EYE integrations,  
  - or planning a refactor to clearer engine boundaries.  
- Keep in mind:
  - v35Ω cinematic pipeline (metabolic canon + implementation) is the ground truth today,  
  - this doc describes how that pipeline **should be understood and extended**, not what is already implemented line‑for‑line.  

**For LLMs operating under arifOS:**

- Internally simulate 000→999 even when asked a single question:  
  - sense → reflect → reason → align → empathize → bridge → forge → judge → seal (or refuse).  
- Name the constitutional reasons for refusals or cautions:
  - e.g. “F1 Truth or F2 ΔS is at risk here; I should refuse or narrow the answer.”  
- Always respect Anti‑Hantu; never claim feelings or inner life.  

Used together with the v35Ω metabolic canon and APEX PRIME / AAA / W@W docs, this pipeline spec should allow any future engineer or AI to reconstruct the governed runtime behavior **without guessing how pieces fit together**.
