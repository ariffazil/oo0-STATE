## Scope & Role

The 777 Cube is the **scar geometry and paradox-to-insight transformation engine** within arifOS:

- **What is 777?** A 3-dimensional coordinate system for tracking scar healing
- **What does 777 do?** Transforms paradoxes into lawful insights via governed cooling
- **Where does 777 sit?** Stage 777 (FORGE) in the 000→999 pipeline
- **How does it integrate?** Gates movement via 9 floors + Φᴘ Crown Equation

### The Paradox Lifecycle

```
Paradox (external conflict)
    ↓ PP (Paradox Physics)
Scar Capture (constitutional wound)
    ↓ 777 Cube geometry
Scar Movement (axes/layers/types)
    ↓ Floor gates + Φᴘ
Phoenix-72 Cooling (72-hour window)
    ↓ Tri-Witness consensus
Vault-999 Canonization (LAW-777)
```

> **Key Principle:** PP stabilizes external contradiction. PS prevents internal illusion. Together they form the Paradox Wave. Φᴘ decides the lawful fate.

## 777 Geometry

The 777 Cube provides a coordinate system for scar tracking and healing.

### Three Axes

| Axis | Name | Domain | Range |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| **X** | Clarity | Δ (Truth, ΔS) | 0-7 |
| **Y** | Stability | Ω (Peace², κᵣ, Ω₀) | 0-7 |
| **Z** | Vitality | Ψ (Amanah, Tri-Witness) | 0-7 |

Each axis corresponds to one of the three core laws (Clarity, Humility, Vitality).

### Seven Layers

| Layer | Name | Description | Gate |
|-------|------|-------------|------|
| **L0** | Raw Paradox | Unprocessed contradiction | Entry point |
| **L1** | Acknowledged | Paradox surfaced, not resolved | ΔS ≥ 0 |
| **L2** | Cooling | In Phoenix-72 window | Peace² ≥ 1.0 |
| **L3** | Pattern | Scar pattern synthesized | κᵣ ≥ 0.95 |
| **L4** | Draft Law | Amendment proposed | Amanah = LOCK |
| **L5** | Witnessed | Tri-Witness consensus | Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95 |
| **L6** | Canon Law | Sealed into Vault-999 | Φᴘ ≥ 1.0 |

### Scar Types

| Type | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Truth Scar** | Δ-scar | Factual error, misinformation |
| **Peace Scar** | Ω-scar | Escalation, harm, destabilization |
| **Integrity Scar** | Ψ-scar | Trust violation, Amanah breach |
| **Paradox Scar** | Φ-scar | Unresolved contradiction |

---

## The Crown Equation (Φᴘ)

From PP–PS Wave Codex, the Crown Equation determines lawful paradox resolution:

```
Φᴘ = (ΔP · Ωᴘ · Ψᴘ · κᵣ · Amanah) / (Lᴘ + Rₘₐ + Λ + ε)
```

### Components

| Symbol | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **ΔP** | Paradox Pressure | How much the world changed the model |
| **Ωᴘ** | Humility Shield | Uncertainty acknowledgment |
| **Ψᴘ** | Cooling Effectiveness | Paradox resolution quality |
| **κᵣ** | Empathy Conductance | Weakest-listener protection |
| **Amanah** | Integrity Lock | No deception, reversible |
| **Lᴘ** | Paradox Instability | Contradiction severity |
| **Rₘₐ** | Maruah Risk | Dignity threat |
| **Λ** | Ambiguity Load | Semantic uncertainty |
| **ε** | Safety constant | Prevents division by zero |

### Verdicts from Φᴘ

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Φᴘ ≥ 1.0** AND PS-clean | Paradox becomes lawful insight |
| **Φᴘ < 1.0** | SABAR / VOID — paradox unstable |
| **PS violation** | VOID — even if Φᴘ ≥ 1.0 |

---

## State Machine & Floors

### Legal Transitions

Movement through 777 layers requires floor satisfaction:

```
L0 → L1: ΔS ≥ 0 (paradox acknowledged clearly)
L1 → L2: Peace² ≥ 1.0 (cooling begins safely)
L2 → L3: κᵣ ≥ 0.95 (pattern respects weakest)
L3 → L4: Amanah = LOCK (amendment is honest)
L4 → L5: Tri-Witness ≥ 0.95 (consensus reached)
L5 → L6: Φᴘ ≥ 1.0 + PS-clean (canonization)
```

### Forbidden Movements

| Movement | Rule | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| Skip layers | **VOID** | No shortcuts through healing |
| Regression without SABAR | **VOID** | Cannot undo progress silently |
| L6 without Φᴘ ≥ 1.0 | **VOID** | Cannot canonize unstable paradox |
| Any layer with PS violation | **VOID** | No internal illusion allowed |

### Floor Gate Matrix

| Layer Transition | Required Floors |
|------------------|-----------------|
| L0 → L1 | F1 (Truth), F2 (ΔS) |
| L1 → L2 | F3 (Peace²) |
| L2 → L3 | F4 (κᵣ), F7 (RASA) |
| L3 → L4 | F6 (Amanah) |
| L4 → L5 | F8 (Tri-Witness) |
| L5 → L6 | Φᴘ ≥ 1.0, F9 (Anti-Hantu/PS-clean) |

## Integration with Pipeline, Phoenix-72, Vault-999

### Stage 777 in 000→999 Pipeline

| Stage | Name | Function | 777 Role |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 000 | VOID | Clear assumptions | — |
| 111 | SENSE | Parse intent | — |
| 222 | REFLECT | Check context | Scar retrieval |
| 333 | REASON (ARIF) | Structure plan | ΔP computation |
| 444 | ALIGN | Verify evidence | — |
| 555 | EMPATHIZE (ADAM) | Stabilize | Ω damping |
| 666 | BRIDGE | Expression | PS-clean check |
| **777** | **FORGE** | **Paradox synthesis** | **Cube movement** |
| 888 | JUDGE (APEX) | Verdict | Φᴘ evaluation |
| 999 | SEAL | Log decision | LAW-777 to Vault |

### Class A vs Class B Routing

| Class | Path | 777 Role |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Class A** (low-stakes) | 111 → 333 → 888 → 999 | Minimal, no cube movement |
| **Class B** (high-stakes) | Full 111→999 with 222, 555, 777 | Full cube processing |

### Phoenix-72 Integration

Phoenix-72 is the **72-hour constitutional cooling window** for scars:

```
Scar captured (VOID verdict)
    ↓
Enter L2 (Cooling layer)
    ↓
72-hour minimum wait
    ↓
Pattern synthesis (L3)
    ↓
Amendment proposal (L4)
    ↓
Tri-Witness consensus (L5)
    ↓
Vault-999 canonization (L6)
```

**Phoenix-72 Phases:**
1. **Scar Capture** — Collect floor failures from Cooling Ledger
2. **Pattern Synthesis** — Group scars by dominant failure
3. **Draft Amendment** — Propose floor adjustment
4. **Apply Amendment** — Update Vault-999 with Phoenix ID
5. **Canonization** — Log as LAW-777 entry

### Vault-999 Integration

When a scar completes the 777 journey and reaches L6:

| Vault Layer | 777 Relationship |
|-------------|------------------|
| **L0** | Constitution (floors that gate 777 movement) |
| **L1** | Cooling Ledger (scar capture from 777) |
| **L2** | Phoenix-72 (scar → pattern → amendment) |
| **L3** | Witness Layer (vector evidence from 777) |
| **L4** | zkPC (zero-knowledge proofs of cognition) |

**LAW-777 Entry Structure:**
```python
law_777_entry = {
    "scar_id": str,           # Original scar identifier
    "cube_path": List[int],   # Journey through 777 layers
    "phoenix_id": str,        # Phoenix-72 cycle that canonized
    "amendment": dict,        # Floor changes applied
    "tri_witness": float,     # Consensus score at L5
    "phi_p": float,           # Crown Equation score at L6
    "sealed_at": timestamp,
}
```

## PARADOX_HOTSPOTS (777)

Known deltas between v36.3Ω 777 canon and current runtime code:

| Hotspot | Canon Spec | Current Code | Resolution |
|---------|------------|--------------|------------|
| **Epoch mismatch (Phoenix)** | Canon: v36.3Ω | Code: `phoenix72.py` declares v33Ω | DELTA — epoch needs update |
| **Epoch mismatch (Scars)** | Canon: v36.3Ω | Code: `scars.py` declares v35Ω | DELTA — epoch needs update |
| **Φᴘ implementation** | Canon: Full Crown Equation | Code: No explicit Φᴘ computation | DELTA — Φᴘ not implemented |
| **777 coordinate system** | Canon: X/Y/Z axes, 7 layers | Code: No cube coordinates | DELTA — cube geometry not implemented |
| **Layer transitions** | Canon: Floor-gated movements | Code: Basic scar collection only | DELTA — state machine not implemented |
| **PS-clean check** | Canon: Required for all L6 | Code: Anti-Hantu exists but not tied to 777 | PARTIAL — needs integration |
| **LAW-777 entries** | Canon: Explicit law entries in Vault | Code: Generic amendments only | DELTA — LAW-777 type not implemented |
| **ΔP computation** | Canon: TAC computes KL divergence | Code: Not implemented | DELTA — future implementation |
| **Paradox instability (Lᴘ)** | Canon: Quantified instability | Code: Not implemented | DELTA — future implementation |

### Priority for v36.4Ω

1. Update epoch declarations in `phoenix72.py` and `scars.py`
2. Implement Φᴘ Crown Equation computation
3. Add 777 cube coordinates to Scar entity
4. Implement layer transition state machine
5. Integrate PS-clean with 777 L6 gate
6. Add LAW-777 entry type to Vault-999
