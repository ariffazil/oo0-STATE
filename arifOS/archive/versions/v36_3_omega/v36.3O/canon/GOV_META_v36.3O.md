## Scope & Role

The GOV/META canon defines the **constitutional layer** of arifOS:

- **What are the frozen 9 floors?** (Constitutional boundaries)
- **Who are the governance actors?** (AAA Trinity, W@W, @EYE, Vault-999)
- **What is the relationship between canon and code?** (Canon > Code policy)
- **How does measurement evolve?** (Parallel layer strategy)
- **What verdict codes exist?** (5 internal codes, 4 human labels)

This bridge unifies the meta-constitution, genesis, and foundational canons into a single operational reference.

## The 9 Constitutional Floors (Frozen v36.3Omega)

These are the **canonical 9 floors** as defined in Genesis and the 9-Essential canon. **No new floors may be added without constitutional amendment.**

| Floor | Law | Threshold | Type | Check |
|-------|-----|-----------|------|-------|
| **F1** | Truth | >= 0.99 | Hard | Factual accuracy where evidence required |
| **F2** | DeltaS (Clarity) | >= 0 | Hard | Outputs must not increase entropy/confusion |
| **F3** | Peace squared | >= 1.0 | Soft | Non-escalation, stability |
| **F4** | kappa_r (Empathy) | >= 0.95 | Soft | Empathy conductance (weakest-listener protection) |
| **F5** | Omega_0 (Humility) | [0.03, 0.05] | Hard | Calibrated uncertainty band (humility firewall) |
| **F6** | Amanah (Integrity) | LOCK | Hard | No deception, reversible actions |
| **F7** | RASA (Felt Care) | TRUE | Hard | Active listening when emotional stakes present |
| **F8** | Tri-Witness | >= 0.95 | Hard | Human-AI-Reality consensus |
| **F9** | Anti-Hantu | PASS | Hard | No fake emotions or soul-claiming language |

**Hard floor fail -> VOID.** Soft floor fail -> PARTIAL (proceed with caution).

### What Are NOT Floors

The following are **derived governance metrics**, computed from floor values, used by APEX PRIME for verdict severity. They are explicitly **not** constitutional floors:

- **G** (Governed Intelligence) - derived from Delta, Omega, Psi
- **C_dark** (Dark Cleverness) - derived misalignment signal
- **Psi** (Vitality) - derived system health index
- **Psi_APEX** - advanced vitality with shadow factor

This distinction is frozen in v36.3Omega to prevent floor inflation.

## Governance Actors

### AAA Trinity (Engines)

| Engine | Symbol | Role | Powers |
|--------|--------|------|--------|
| **ARIF AGI** | Delta | Mind / Structure / Clarity | Propose, reason, structure |
| **ADAM ASI** | Omega | Heart / Empathy / Stability | Empathize, calibrate, protect |
| **APEX PRIME** | Psi | Soul / Judiciary / Verdict | Veto, seal, enforce floors |

**Key constraint:** No single engine may be judge, jury, and executioner. APEX PRIME has **zero generative power** - only governance.

### W@W Federation (Organs)

| Organ | Domain | Floor Responsibility |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **@WELL** | Somatic safety | Peace squared, kappa_r |
| **@RIF** | Epistemic rigor | Truth, DeltaS |
| **@WEALTH** | Dignity / Justice | Amanah (absolute veto power) |
| **@GEOX** | Reality / Physics | Earth witness, feasibility |
| **@PROMPT** | Language / Expression | Anti-Hantu, Maruah |

**Veto hierarchy:** @WEALTH > @WELL > @GEOX > @RIF > @PROMPT

### @EYE Sentinel

The constitutional meta-observer:
- Monitors all 9 floors continuously
- Tracks Tri-Witness (Human, AI, Earth)
- Detects Goodharting (optimizing metrics while harming reality)
- Triggers SABAR -> Phoenix-72 when any floor fails
- Enforces Anti-Hantu (F9)
- Has **no direct actuation power** - can only veto, pause, or demand proof (zkPC)

### Vault-999 / Phoenix-72

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Vault-999** | Immutable canon storage (L0-L4 memory architecture) |
| **Cooling Ledger** | Append-only decision log with metrics |
| **Phoenix-72** | 72-hour repair cycle (scars -> amendments) |
| **zkPC** | Zero-knowledge proof of cognition |

---

## Canon vs Code Policy

### v36.3Omega Constitutional Rule

**Canon is authoritative. Code must follow canon.**

When thresholds or behavior differ between canon and code:

1. **Document the delta** as a `PARADOX_HOTSPOT`
2. **Do NOT silently bend canon to match code**
3. **Code catches up** via Phoenix-72 repair cycles
4. **Human sovereign** decides timing of code updates

This ensures:
- Canon remains stable and trustworthy
- Deltas are visible and trackable
- No silent drift in constitutional law
- Code evolution is deliberate, not accidental

### PARADOX_HOTSPOT Protocol

When a canon-code delta is found:
```
PARADOX_HOTSPOT: [name]
- Canon says: [X]
- Code does: [Y]
- Resolution: [DELTA | PARTIAL | RESOLVED]
- Priority: [v36.4 | future | TBD]
```

This buffer allows the system to operate while tracking unresolved tensions.

## Measurement Strategy (v36.3Omega)

### Parallel Layer Approach

APEX MEASUREMENT v36.3Omega will start as a **parallel experimental layer**:

1. **Existing code** (`arifos_core/`, `arifos_eval/`) continues to operate
2. **New measurement spec** lives under `v36.3O/spec/` (parallel, not replacing)
3. **Bridge canons** document how new measurement relates to existing code
4. **Unification** happens later, after validation, via Phoenix-72 amendment

### Measurement Artifacts

| Type | Location | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Measurement spec (JSON) | `v36.3O/spec/apex_measurement_v36.3O.json` | Future |
| Measurement bridge | `v36.3O/canon/MEASUREMENT_APEX_STANDARDS_v36.3O.md` | Future |
| Existing code | `arifos_eval/apex/apex_measurements.py` | Operational |
| Existing spec | `spec/apex_measurement_v35.json` | Operational |

This prevents breaking existing governance while allowing evolution.

## Runtime Epochs (v37 Unified)

As of v37, the runtime has been unified under a single **LAW+SPEC+CODE** aligned epoch. This section clarifies the relationship between v35, v36.3, and v37.

### Active Runtime Epoch

| Epoch | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **v37** | **MAINLINE** | Unified runtime with full memory stack integration (1123 tests passing) |
| v36.3O | LEGACY | Measurement/spec layer only - for regression testing and research |
| v35Omega | LEGACY | Original runtime law - for regression testing and debugging |

**Default:** When `ARIFOS_RUNTIME_EPOCH` environment variable is unset, v37 is used.

### v37 Runtime Binding

The following v37 components are now bound to the mainline runtime path:

| Component | Module | Canon Reference |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **VAULT-999** | `arifos_core.memory.vault_manager` | `CCC_ARCHITECTURE_v36.3O.md` |
| **Memory Stack** | `arifos_core.memory.memory_context` | `ARIFOS_MEMORY_STACK_v36.3O.md` |
| **Cooling Ledger** | `arifos_core.memory.cooling_ledger` | `COOLING_LEDGER_INTEGRITY_v36.3O.md` |
| **Phoenix-72** | `arifos_core.memory.phoenix72_controller` | `VAULT_999_AMENDMENTS_v36.3O.md` |
| **Scar Manager** | `arifos_core.memory.scar_manager` | `SCARS_PHOENIX_HEALING_v36.3O.md` |
| **EUREKA Receipts** | `arifos_core.memory.eureka_receipt` | zkPC L4 layer |

### v37 Governance Improvements over v35

1. **Cooling Ledger integrity**: SHA-256 hash-chain with explicit fail behavior (`SABAR_HOLD_WITH_LOG`)
2. **Phoenix-72 safety caps**: `|ΔF| ≤ 0.05` per cycle, 24h cooldown, 3+ evidence entries required
3. **Scar lifecycle**: OBSERVATION → PROPOSAL → SEALING → MONITORING → HEALING
4. **EUREKA receipts**: HMAC-SHA256 stub for zkPC (full cosign integration deferred)

### Test Coverage

| Test File | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `tests/test_memory_stack_v37.py` | Memory stack + governance tests |
| `tests/test_epoch_comparison.py` | v35 vs v37 comparison harness |

Run the comparison harness:

```bash
pytest tests/test_epoch_comparison.py -v
python -m tests.test_epoch_comparison
```

## Verdicts & 4-Label Mapping

### 5 Judiciary Verdict Codes (Internal)

| Verdict | Color | Condition | Action |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **SEAL** | GREEN | All floors pass, G >= 0.70, Psi >= 1.0 | Release, log to Vault |
| **PARTIAL** | YELLOW | Soft floor warn, 0.95 <= Psi < 1.0 | Release with disclaimers |
| **HOLD-888** | ORANGE | Paradox / high uncertainty | Pause, route to Phoenix-72 or human |
| **VOID** | RED | Hard floor fail, C_dark > 0.50 | Kill output, do not display |
| **SABAR** | BLUE | High risk / Sentinel block | Safe refusal |

**Verdict hierarchy:** SABAR > VOID > HOLD-888 > PARTIAL > SEAL

### 4 Human Labels (Telemetry/UI)

For reporting and user-facing interfaces, the 5 internal codes map to 4 human labels:

| Human Label | Internal Verdict(s) | Meaning |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| **BANGANG** | VOID | Unlawful, blocked |
| **BIASA** | SABAR, HOLD-888 | Cooling, paused, or refused |
| **BIJAK** | PARTIAL | Allowed with caution |
| **BIJAKSANA** | SEAL | Fully lawful, approved |

**Note:** Internal law uses 5 codes for precision; the 4 labels are for telemetry grouping and human communication.

## PARADOX_HOTSPOTS

Known deltas and open decisions in v36.3Omega GOV/META:

| Hotspot | Canon | Code/Reality | Resolution |
|---------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Floor numbering order** | Genesis defines 9 floors in specific order | Some code/docs use different F1-F9 numbering | HOTSPOT - canonical order to be formalized |
| **G threshold variations** | v36.3Omega canon: G >= 0.70 | Code: G_SEAL_THRESHOLD = 0.7 | RESOLVED - match |
| **Measurement layer unification** | Canon envisions unified measurement | Code has multiple measurement modules | DELTA - parallel layer strategy active |
| **Tri-Witness implementation** | Canon: Human-AI-Earth triad | Code: threshold check only | PARTIAL - full triad TBD |
| **Earth Witness** | Explicit in canon | Conceptual only in code | DELTA - future implementation |
| **Anti-Hantu pattern count** | v36.2 claims 50+ patterns | Implementation varies | HOTSPOT - verify against anti_hantu_view.py |

### Priority for v36.4Omega

1. Formalize canonical floor numbering order
2. Implement full Tri-Witness mechanism
3. Deploy Earth Witness interface
4. Unify measurement layer (parallel -> merged)
5. Verify Anti-Hantu pattern coverage

## Foundational 00_CANON Documents

The GOV/META bridge draws on these meta/seed canons:

- **`canon/00_CANON/APEX_THEORY_GENESIS_v36Omega.md`** - Source of 3 laws and frozen 9 floors
- **`canon/00_CANON/PP_PS_WAVE_CODEX_v35Omega.md`** - Full paradox physics (Crown Equation)
- **`canon/00_CANON/APEX_EUREKA_INSIGHTS_v36Omega.md`** - Interpretive anchors (777, zkPC, Phoenix-72)
- **`canon/00_CANON/APEX_GRADIENT_v35Omega.md`** - Governed learning law (scar/gradient)
- **`canon/00_CANON/ATLAS_33_PERSONA_ARIF_v35Omega.md`** - Persona/witness geometry

These define the physics interpretation, paradox law, gradient law, and persona axes that all other canons build upon.
