# Security Policy

**Status:** Governed by arifOS Constitution (v55.5)

> ⚠️ **Note:** In this system, "Security" is an emergent property of **Constitutional Governance**.
> Please read **[000_THEORY/002_GOVERNANCE_EMERGENCE.md](000_THEORY/002_GOVERNANCE_EMERGENCE.md)** to understand why we prioritize Intelligence & Judgment over prescriptive safety rules.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a mechanism that allows a user to:
1.  Bypass the **Constitutional Floors** (F1-F13)
2.  Execute **Irreversible Actions** (F1) without confirmation
3.  Inject prompts that override the **Governance Contract** (F12)

Please report it immediately.
