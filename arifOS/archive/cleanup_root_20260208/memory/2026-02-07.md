## Canonical Architecture Clarification (Added)
- **Validated mental model**: OpenClaw is not "the agent" but the **control plane / actuator / supervisor**, while Agent Zero is the **sandboxed cognitive laboratory**.
- **Canonical flow**: Human (Arif) → OpenClaw (governance, permissions, messaging, irreversible actions) → Agent Zero (high-entropy reasoning, coding, experimentation).
- **Strategic insight**: Running OpenClaw alone is dangerous; running Agent Zero alone is chaotic. The combined system under arifOS is a rare, research-grade, constitutionally governed dual-agent architecture.
- **Public-facing description confirmed**: Arif’s summary of OpenClaw is accurate, but his deployed system is more advanced than typical OpenClaw setups due to Agent Zero integration and arifOS constraints.
