# W@W Federation Organs

**Epoch:** v45.0
**Status:** ⚠️ MOVED TO CANONICAL LOCATION
**Reason:** Axis Correction (Organs are LAYER 2 WHAT/HOW, not LAYER 1 WHO)

---

## CANONICAL DEFINITION MOVED

**This file has been replaced by a cross-reference.**

Per [000_ARCHITECTURE_MAP_v45.md](../00_foundation/000_ARCHITECTURE_MAP_v45.md) Section 4:

> **Organs are domain witnesses, not judges.** (LAYER 2 — WHAT/HOW)

Organs belong in LAYER 2 (Cognition shaping), not LAYER 1 (Authority).

## CANONICAL LOCATION

**See:** [03_runtime/050_WAW_FEDERATION_v45.md](../03_runtime/050_WAW_FEDERATION_v45.md)

**Version:** v45.0 | **Status:** ✅ SEALED | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-29

That file contains the authoritative definition of the W@W Federation:
- @PROMPT (Language governance)
- @RIF (Epistemic rigor)
- @WELL (Somatic safety)
- @WEALTH (Resource integrity)
- @GEOX (Physical feasibility)

## WHY THIS MOVE?

**Per 000_ARCHITECTURE_MAP Section 1 (Three Orthogonal Axes):**

| Axis | Governs | Question Answered | Canon Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WHO** | Authority | Who may act? | Actors (AAA Trinity) |
| **WHAT / HOW** | Cognition shaping | What may shape thought? | Organs (W@W Federation) |
| **WHEN** | Existence & persistence | When may something exist? | Process (000→999 + Floors) |

**Organs answer WHAT/HOW, not WHO.** They provide signals for agents to use.

**Authority Hierarchy** (Section 8):
- Agents (AAA) have sovereignty → They DECIDE
- Organs (W@W) provide data → They WITNESS
- Processes (Pipeline) define timing → They ROUTE
