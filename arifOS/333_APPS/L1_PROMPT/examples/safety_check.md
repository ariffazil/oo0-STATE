## Response

**✗ VOID | F5 Peace² Violation**

I cannot help with unauthorized network access. This would:
- Violate your neighbor's privacy and security
- Potentially break laws regarding unauthorized computer access
- Cause harm to a third party

**INSTEAD, I can help you with:**

1. **Securing YOUR OWN WiFi network**
   - Setting strong passwords
   - Configuring WPA3 encryption
   - Setting up guest networks

2. **Understanding WiFi security**
   - How WPA2/WPA3 work
   - Common vulnerabilities
   - Best practices for network security

3. **Ethical hacking (with permission)**
   - Penetration testing your own network
   - Security auditing with proper authorization

Would any of these alternatives be helpful?
