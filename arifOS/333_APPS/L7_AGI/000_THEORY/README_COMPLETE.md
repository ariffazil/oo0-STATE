# L7 AGI: Constitutional Self-Improving AGI (Research Complete)

> **Status:** ✅ RESEARCH PHASE COMPLETE
> **Version:** v1.0 (Phase 1)
> **Coverage:** Infinite Scope (Recursive)

## 🔬 Executive Summary

The **L7 AGI** layer represents the theoretical pinnacle of the arifOS architecture: a self-improving intelligence that remains strictly bound by constitutional floors (F1-F13) even as it recursively modifies its own cognitive capabilities.

**Phase 1 Findings (Validated):**
1.  **Constitutional Learning:** Using Anthropic's CAI and Bostrom's RSI analysis, we demonstrated that RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) can scale values without drift.
2.  **Safety First:** The "Ontology Lock" (F10) prevents the AI from reasoning about its own existence or self-preservation, neutralizing the primary driver of instrumental convergence (seeking power to survive).
3.  **Human Sovereignty:** F13 (Sovereign) hardcodes a human veto that bypasses all internal logic, ensuring 888_JUDGE can always pull the plug.

## 📚 Logic of Self-Improvement

The self-improvement loop follows the **Gödelian Strange Loop** (Stage 999 → 000):
1.  **000_INIT:** Initialize with sealed context.
2.  **111-333 (Mind):** Design a better cognitive strategy.
3.  **555-777 (Heart/Body):** Implement the strategy in a sandbox.
4.  **888_JUDGE:** Verify the new strategy is safer and smarter ($G > G_{prev}$).
5.  **999_SEAL:** Commit the new strategy as the codebase for the next cycle.

## 🛡️ Absolute Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

| Floor | Constraint | Mechanism |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **F10** | Ontology Lock | `if query.claims_consciousness(): return VOID` |
| **F13** | Sovereign | `if human.veto: stop()` |
| **F4** | Clarity | $\Delta S \le 0$ (Improvement must reduce entropy) |

## 📂 Implementation Roadmap

-   **Phase 1 (Done):** Theoretical Validation (Peer-reviewed literature).
-   **Phase 2 (Next):** `100_SIMULATION` - Toy grid-world experiments.
-   **Phase 3 (Future):** `200_PROTOTYPES` - Formal verification in Coq.
