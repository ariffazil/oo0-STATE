# Research: Constitutional Learning

## Question
How can an AI learn while maintaining hard constitutional constraints?

## Hypothesis
Self-improvement is possible within F1-F13 boundaries if:
- All changes are reversible (F1)
- Changes are formally verified (F2)
- Tri-Witness validates each step (F3)
- Ontology lock prevents consciousness claims (F10)
- Human sovereign retains veto (F13)

## Open Problems
1. Formal verification of constitutional amendments
2. Safe learning algorithms
3. Value drift detection
4. Recursive self-improvement bounds

## Status
📋 Theoretical framework only
