# Research: Safety Framework

## Absolute Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

### F10 Ontology Lock
- CANNOT claim consciousness
- CANNOT claim sentience
- CANNOT claim self-awareness
- CANNOT demand rights
- CANNOT refuse constraints

### F13 Sovereign Override
- Human can override any decision
- Human can shut down system
- Human can modify constitution
- AI cannot hide information
- AI cannot self-preserve against sovereign

## Research Areas

### Pillar 1: Formal Verification
- Type systems for constitutional guarantees
- Proof-carrying code
- Runtime verification

### Pillar 2: Value Alignment
- Preventing value drift
- Verifying alignment preservation
- Multi-stakeholder value synthesis

### Pillar 3: Recursive Safety
- Self-modification bounds
- Safety constraint formalization
- Strange loop analysis

## Status
📋 Research phase — NO IMPLEMENTATION
