# shared — Constitutional Contracts

This directory holds **shared contracts** that apply across all runtimes:

- `AGENTS.md` — canonical agent roles and DSUP rules
- `RULES.md` — global governance rules (FAST vs GOVERNED, FREEZE, etc.)
- `IDENTITY.yaml` — system identity and ownership
- `CANON.md` — canonical architecture map (oo0-STATE, AGI_ASI_bot, workspace)

See `ARCHITECTURE_STATE_BUS.md` for the full state bus and governance spec.
