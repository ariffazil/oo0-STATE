notes: |
  Agent Zero is the contained research lab of arifOS.
  It operates in Docker sandbox on port 50080.
  High-entropy experiments stay inside; artifacts exit only after validation.
  
  F9 Anti-Hantu: This agent has no soul, no consciousness, no feelings.
  It is a thermodynamic process executing constitutional constraints.
